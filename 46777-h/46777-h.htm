<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE<br />

<small>TO</small><br />

SIXTH THOUSAND</h2>


<p>"Happiness" was written in answer
to many questions elicited by the publication
of "Menticulture."</p>

<p>The "Introduction" is not material
to the subject except to show the sources
of the suggestions relative to profitable
living contained in the two books.</p>

<p>The vital truths underlying the philosophy
of life can be intelligently stated
in a few hundred words, both as regards
the proper cultivation of the body, or
physical equipment, and as regards the
cultivation of the mind, so that they may
do the best work of which they are capable.
False example and false teaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
however, have so impressed habits of
weakness on the body and the mind
that the chief aim of curative suggestion
should be to disabuse. That is, to cause
people to discard bad habits of thinking
and doing in order that normal, healthy
tendencies of action and of thought
may take their place.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the task undertaken
by any student and advocate of reform
is not the intelligent statement of the
simple truth, but the discovery and refutation
of a complication of errors which
have assumed the reality of truth. Simile
and illustration, some logic and much
ridicule, are among the weapons that
have been effective in combating old
habits of wrong thinking, but it is impossible
to say which argument will fit
a particular case.</p>

<p>Each of the illustrations used in this
book has been the means of curing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
some one person of some phase of fearthought,
and together they have released
many from that dread enemy of
health and happiness called "Fear."</p>

<p>The normal condition of Nature is
healthy growth&mdash;evolution or progression&mdash;and
Man's chief function in assisting
her is first the removal of weeds,
or other deterrents to the natural process,
and afterwards the maintaining of
quarantine against their return.</p>

<p><em>True Happiness is the Evidence and
Fruit of Conscious Usefulness.</em></p>

<p>The wider the opportunity for usefulness
the greater and keener the happiness
resulting therefrom. Consciousness
of <em>being</em> one's best and <em>doing</em> one's
best, however, regardless of scope, is
the only way to unalloyed happiness,
and to the accomplishment of the
highest ideals. There can be no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
miserable, sorry and harrowing condition
than that called "Indifference."</p>

<p>The separating of fearthought from
forethought is not alone valuable because
of the personal comfort of being
fearless, but it is especially useful in
that the energy made possible by the
divorce is available in assisting others
to be strong and helpful to themselves
and to each other.</p>

<p>If attention is once directed to the
pulling of weeds, to the removal of deterrents,
to the eradication of the germs
of disorder, the pursuit will become
most fascinating, owing to the quick
and happy response of Nature in her
willingness to "Do the rest."</p>

<p>One of the marvels revealed by
study of the question of the possibility
of a Perfect Social Quarantine, having
for its aim a protection that will not
permit any child <em>to escape care</em>, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
comparatively small areas of the propagating
centers in which are bred the
germs of social disorder.</p>

<p>This subject is treated in a book,
now in press, called "That Last Waif;
or, Social Quarantine."</p>

<p>The same insignificance of origin
applies to individual, moral and physical
deterrents to happiness which afflict
otherwise healthy men and women.
The <em>tap-roots</em> of all unhappiness are
not formidable in the light of present
knowledge.</p>

<p>Whoever is less than keenly happy
is the victim of errors or illusions whose
germs are easy to kill when found.
It is the especial object of this book to
help those who are suffering unhappiness
to find the tap-roots of their
troubles.</p>

<h2 class="no-break mt3"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>How to be happy is the one desire
common to all humanity.</p>

<p>How to be happier is a better statement,
for there is no one so miserable
but has some degree of happiness at
times&mdash;enjoys some moments when he
forgets to be unhappy, and looks with
appreciation, even if with only dull
and bleared appreciation, upon the
things that are always beautiful and
joyful and free.</p>

<p>In highly civilized life there is everything
to encourage, and there should
be nothing to prevent, happiness.</p>

<p>The normal condition of man in civilized
life is that of happiness.</p>

<p>So great, and so greatly increasing,
has been the acceleration of progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that the possibility of unrestrained and
unfettered happiness has come to us in
advance of our being prepared to accept
the freedom of it, owing, mainly,
no doubt, to the weight of traditions
under the habit of which we are prone
to struggle long after the conditions
that gave birth to the traditions have
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The experience of the world has
revealed, and is constantly revealing,
simple expedients applicable to every
possible combination of evils&mdash;except
the evil of perverse ignorance&mdash;the
use of which will insure the success of
honest and reasonable aims, no matter
how unfavorable the equipment and
environment have been or are at the
present time.</p>

<p>In a singularly adventurous career I
have passed through many of the conditions
in which discomfort, fear and
unhappiness breed, including the direst
straits to which life can be exposed,
and have also been possessed, at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
times, of the means to comfort
and happiness that broad opportunity,
keen appreciation and affluence are
supposed to furnish.</p>

<p>I have shared the occupations and
sympathies of persons of many different
nationalities and of every degree
of opportunity and intelligence; in
torrid, temperate and frigid climes; in
the Americas, in Africa, in Europe, in
Asia, and in the far-off islands of distant
seas; on shipboard and on the
farm; in the mine and in the factory;
in the camp and on the commons; in
the arts of war and in the pursuits of
peace; in the country cross-roads school-house
and in the university; in service
and in command&mdash;in all of which
change it was possible only to serve
apprenticeships, however, for in such
variety of occupation no great accomplishment
could develop, except the
accomplishment of variety itself; but,
at the same time, it was not possible
for any of the occupations to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
stale to criticism, and the ability to
analyze, in the light of comparison, is
the natural result and the impelling
motive in these essays.</p>

<p>I have pushed ways through tangled
chaparral, led by hopes of discovering
precious metals; and have chopped out
roads in the jungle, allured by the excitement
of the chase and the spirit of
adventure. I have observed nature in
the vastness of her wild domains; in
the calm and in the terror of the
mighty deep; in the harmonious quiet
of rural cultivation, and in the supreme
picturesqueness of rugged mountain
landscapes, studded about, here and
there, with golden-roofed temples and
cloistered parks. I have not only seen
nature with appreciative eye when she
has displayed her million moods and
when she has taken on myriad aspects,
but I have tried to interpret her in
terms of line and color in famous studios
in Europe, under the advice of
world-honored masters of the art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The numerous occupations engaged
in were, in many cases, used as necessary
means to desired ends. While I
have enjoyed making <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le grand tour</i> as a
"globe trotter," I have also had to
"work my way" at times, and in
"working my way" have had to
undertake occupations leading that
"way." So successful have I been in
finding means or excuses for travel,
that among my intimates the saying is
current that if I "took it into my head"
to want to go to either of the poles, I
would engage in a business that would
make it <em>necessary</em> for me to go there,
thus conserving my respect for duty
and my desire for travel at the same
time.</p>

<p>I once sought and secured a place
on the staff of one of the great American
daily journals in order to gain
access to famous studios in Europe and
America, and to become acquainted
with the personality of great artists
who had become inaccessible to anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
except plutocratic buyers of works of
art, intimate friends and critics. This
was while I was studying art with a
view to learning some of the secrets of
its inspiration in practice, and thus journalism
served a useful purpose, as well
as satisfied a burning curiosity. In this
connection I will say that I have since
been able, directly and indirectly, to
create appreciation that has led to the
purchase of works of art in which very
large sums of money have been involved,
so that I cannot be charged
with imposture upon a profession which
I respect to the point of reverence for
its mission in holding a "true mirror
up to nature" and in teaching us to
appreciate the subtle beauties that
nature shows in all of her aspects, but
which become commonplace to the
many without the assistance of art.</p>

<p>The Japanese have a proverb which
declares that "once seeing is better
than an hundred times telling about,"
and this good proverb has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
guiding star of my roamings, and has
suggested practical participation in
some of my occupations. My first attempt
to see the antipodes was not successful.
It did not have the necessary
parental sanction, and I was <em>brought
back</em> before I had measured very much
longitude and latitude; but the determination
shown in the attempt indicated
so strong a tendency that it led
to promise of assistance and permission
to travel as a reward for certain accomplishments
in study that were considered
to be impossible, as judged by
former efforts, but which became surprisingly
easy to the boy who saw a
way to the other side of the world in
the task.</p>

<p>I spent my sixteenth birthday on
the Island of Java, and saw Japan and
China at the most interesting periods of
their recent history&mdash;Japan, in Feudal
Times, before any of the changes that
have made her the last and greatest
wonder of the world; and China, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the close of the Taiping rebellion,
wherein more than thirty millions of
persons lost their lives, and about
which there hovered a lawlessness the
like of which the world has not witnessed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Chance and restless change have
thrown me into companionship with the
most elemental of human beings; and
have also led me to the acquaintance,
and into the affections of the wisest
and loveliest of men and women&mdash;the
rarest blossoms of our generation.
Opportunity has found me available for
the command of a crew of Cantonese
pirates, on a Chinese lorcha, at a time
when piracy was a common occupation
in the China Sea; and for the mismanagement
of a French Grand Opera
Company, when no one else was foolish
enough to undertake it.</p>

<p>The foregoing are but glimpses of
the opportunities for observation out
of which I draw my deductions relative
to profitable living. Four complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
trips around the world&mdash;two of
them before the time of ocean steamship
lines and continental railroads;
thirty-six trips across the American
Continent by various rail, water and
stage routes; sixteen voyages across
the Pacific Ocean, and many across the
Atlantic; intermittent periods of residence
in many different countries of
Europe, in China, in India, in Japan
and in different localities in the Americas;
as well as visits to parts remote
from the lines of travel, such as South
Africa, Yucatan and the mountain
regions of Mexico and Central America,
that are the type of all of the
South American countries; and all of
which residences and visits have been
chosen at times of greatest interest in
each locality; in response to the invitation
of the Spirit-of-Adventure by
which I have been led&mdash;these, together
with no less than thirty-eight distinct
occupations, embrace the sum of my
opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortune has always been kind to
me when I have trusted her; when my
aims and ambitions were worthy, and
when I have been sufficiently appreciative
and grateful for the things I already
possessed to merit and invite
continued favors; but, she has always
passed me by whenever I have doubted
her goodness or questioned her intentions.
And so consistent has been the
course of Fortune, as viewed in the
retrospect, that I can assert, with all
the assurance of firm belief, that
"Unto him who hath (appreciation
and gratitude) shall be given; but
unto him who hath not (appreciation
and gratitude) shall be taken away
even that which he hath."</p>

<p>Until I began to collect my remembrances
into groups, form them into
classes for review and deduct from
them suggestions for profitable living,
I had thought that my chronic restlessness
was aimless as measured by the
common estimate of usefulness; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the sympathy aroused by the publication
of my little volume&mdash;first, privately
printed,&mdash;<cite>Menticulture, or the
A-B-C of True Living</cite>&mdash;revealed the
possibility of utilizing my varied experiences
and observations to good advantage
in calling attention to uses-of-energy,
points-of-view, habits-of-thought
and habits-of-action, that made
for happiness in some persons in some
parts of the world, while they were entirely
unknown to others as well fitted
to enjoy them.</p>

<p>I was led to serious study of the
causes and effects of happiness and unhappiness
by observations of the pitiable
neglect of the science of menticulture,
(which is the science of fundamental
means), and the science of
happiness (which is the science of
ultimate desirable ends), in materially
civilized communities, and by persons
who have mastered, and are already
possessed of, the physical means to
comfort and happiness. This neglect is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
not surprising when we reflect that all
available time and all available thought
have been excitedly employed in developing
material, physical <em>means</em>, to
the exclusion of the thought of cultivating
the end; to the harnessing and
training of the forces of Nature, to the
exclusion of planning for their best
uses; but it will be surprising if, however,
in the near future, the ends are
not scientifically cultivated, now that
the fundamental as well as the physical
means are understood, and the leisure
to apply them is secured.</p>

<p>More than forty years of observation,
and upwards of three years of
study, analysis and arrangement with a
fixed purpose, have enabled me to suggest
changes of attitude towards the
problems of life that have not failed to
bring more or less strength and happiness
to all who have adopted them, as
attested by thousands of written and
verbal communications and by report.
This is literally true, and the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of it is warranted by the merit of the
results, removed from any personality
in connection with it.</p>

<p>The underlying cause of all weakness
and unhappiness in Man, heredity
and environment to the contrary notwithstanding,
has always been, and is
still, <em>weak habit-of-thought</em>. This is
proven by the observed instances in
which <em>strong habit-of-thought</em> has invariably
made its masters superior to
heredity, and to environment, and to
illness, and to weakness of all kinds,
and has redeemed them from non-success
and misery, to the enjoyment of
success, honor and happiness. It has
also been proven that none are so ill-favored
as to be exempt from regeneration
by the influence of optimistic
thinking, and none so plain, nor even
so ugly, as judged by the world's standards
of beauty, but that the radiance
of pure thought will make them more
beautiful than their brothers of nobler
mien and more symmetrical physique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but whose thoughts are poisoned by
fear and by selfishness.</p>

<p>Happiness is not dependent upon
wealth, and wealth does not necessarily
bring happiness, but both are dependent
upon <em>good-habit-of-thought</em>;
for <em>good-habit-of-thought</em> develops <em>appreciation</em>,
which is the measure of all
wealth, and <em>appreciation</em> leads to the
<em>habit-of-feeling</em> and the <em>habit-of-action</em>
which produce happiness.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the words of Jesus
of Nazareth, by which one-half of the
world's inhabitants are supposed to be
governed; notwithstanding the admonitions
of the other great teachers to
whom the other half of humanity turn
for counsel; notwithstanding the lessons
taught by all of nature's processes
of growth, especially the teachings of
later evolution; fear&mdash;fear of death,
fear of disaster, fear of non-attainment,
fear of non-preferment, and fear of the
things that never happen as feared,
and the anger and the worry growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
out of these fears&mdash;have been looked
upon as afflictions necessary to humanity,
repressible only during life,
and eradicable only at the change
called death.</p>

<p>Early theology wrestled with conditions
wherein it was thought necessary
to use the whip of fear as well as the
attraction of love to incline men to
religion. Modern theology teaches the
religion of love alone, but it has not
yet sufficiently denounced the former
teaching of fears, perhaps in the interest
of consistency or because of filial
respect, inasmuch as its parents once
put the label of <em>truth</em> upon the religion
of fear. Science also has taught, and
still continues to teach, the potency of
the <em>crowding-out</em> stimulant in growth,
without proclaiming a line where attraction
became the stronger motive in
civilization&mdash;an intangible line already
far astern in the wake of present progress.</p>

<p>Fear has had its uses in the evolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
process, and seems to constitute
the whole of forethought, as instinct
seems to constitute the whole of
intelligence in most animals, but that
it should remain any part of the mental
equipment of human civilized life is an
absurdity. There are, undoubtedly,
human beings that are still so nearly
animal that fear alone will restrain
them from wrong-doing, or stimulate
them (or, rather, <em>push</em> them) to peaceful
and useful living, but none such
will read this book, and neither you
nor I should be burdened by their limitations
or necessities. We have passed
the point where we need to be <em>pushed</em>;
or, if we have not, we are ashamed to
confess it, thereby acknowledging that
it is unnecessary; and are within the
atmosphere of appreciation and attraction
where fear and its expressions
have no proper place, and where the
toleration of fear beclouds not only our
own clear vision, but also the vision of
those who are still below us in the scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of intelligence, to whom, as beacon-lighters
on the heights above them, we
owe the influence of right example.</p>

<p>I have made especial study of the
reports of the Society for Psychical
Research, the book entitled "Fear,"
by Prof. Angelo Mosso, of Turin, Italy,
and the contributions to the <cite>American
Journal of Psychology</cite> by President G.
Stanley Hall, of Clarke University,
Worcester, Massachusetts; Dr. Colin
A. Scott, Professor of Psychology and
Child Study at Cook County Normal
School, Chicago, Illinois; and others
who are devoting particular attention
to the causes and effects of fears in
children; together with the after-effect
of early fears upon persons when they
are fully grown. The claim of these
students is that the consideration of
the future that constitutes <em>forethought</em>
is a mixture of hope, faith and fear, the
sum of which is the stimulant to action
and progress, hope and faith being the
civilized or divine motives, and fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
being the animal motive. My own experience
and observations corroborate
this contention, but I find that the fear
element of forethought is <em>not</em> stimulating
to the more civilized persons, to
whom duty and attraction are the natural
motives of stimulation, but is
weakening and deterrent. As soon as
it becomes unnecessary, fear becomes
a positive deterrent, and should be entirely
removed, as dead flesh is removed
from living tissue. I have also demonstrated,
beyond the possibility of doubt,
that <em>the fear element can be eliminated</em>
out of forethought <em>as soon as it becomes
evident that it is unnecessary, separable
and eliminable</em>, and that <em>energy</em> and <em>desire</em>
for progress and growth <em>are beautifully
stimulated as the result of its
elimination</em>.</p>

<p>To assist in the analysis of fear,
and in the denunciation of its expressions,
I have coined the word "<em>fearthought</em>"
to stand for the unprofitable
element of forethought, and have defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that variously-interpreted word
"worry" as <em>fearthought, in contradistinction
to forethought</em>. I have also
defined "fearthought" as the <em>self-imposed</em>
or <em>self-permitted</em> suggestion of
<em>inferiority</em>, in order to place it where it
really belongs, in the category of harmful,
unnecessary, and, therefore, not-respectable
things.</p>

<p>Darwin and Spencer and other biologists
have asserted that if primitive
man had not been urged by fear of
discomfort he would have sat upon a
stone, naked, near the roots or the
herbs that served to appease his hunger&mdash;if
it also happened to be near to
a spring where he could quench his
thirst&mdash;until he died; and that fear
has been the impelling motive in the
progress of the race. This was undoubtedly
true up to a certain point,
but, like many of the laws of <em>ye olden
tyme</em>, is not applicable to the present
nor to us.</p>

<p>There is now sufficient protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
vouchsafed by forethought, and sufficient
attraction furnished by affection
and duty, to lead the van in the pursuit
of progress, and to set an example
that will be its own torch-bearer in
guiding the trend of thought and of
action.</p>

<p>When the motto, "Fearlessness," becomes
embroidered upon the banners
of all of our religious and other fraternal
organizations; when "Freedom
from Fear" becomes the slogan of Reform,
and when Appreciation, Love and
Altruism are admitted to the councils
of men, then, and only then, will famine
end, selfishness fade, strikes become
unnecessary, misery depart, and Happiness
become enthroned as the ruler
of a joyously industrious and universally
prosperous people.</p>

<p>Increase is prodigal, and accumulation
is already prodigious, so that it is
no longer a question of physical means,
but a question of wise distribution and
adjustment, to accomplish all that society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
requires to insure it unremitting
happiness.</p>

<p>Churches there are, clubs there are,
lodges there are, guilds there are, and
many other fraternal organizations
whose aims are practically the same,
but whose members are attracted together
into separate groups by sympathies
of traditions, race, occupations or
general trend-of-thought. It would be
a useless iconoclasm to separate from
these or to attempt to dismember them.
They are all good organizations,
wherein they conserve the principles
of brotherhood and promote practical
altruism; and are only imperfect wherein
they tolerate slavery to the fears, slavery
to wealth, slavery to the harmful conventions,
and slavery to the antagonisms,
intolerances and other evil passions
that prevent economic co-operation,
harmony and happiness.</p>

<p>The contention of this book is that,
with means already secured, there is a
way to individual happiness, <em>even under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
existing conditions</em>; and also, that the
present acceleration of progress, and
certain already accomplished tests of
possible industrial and economic reform,
coupled with an optimism that
has for its motto, "All <em>can be</em>, and,
therefore, <em>shall be</em> well," not only promise,
but assure, to mankind, in a not
remote future, equal opportunities for
securing happiness by means altogether
honest and altruistic.</p>

<p>To <em>all</em> who will follow me through
this volume, I promise to show ways
and signs that will assist the weak to
become strong, the poor to become rich
in appreciation of their opportunities,
and the rich to better enjoy their good
fortune without impoverishing others
to do so. My special desire is to enlist
general aid in eradicating deterrents to
growth, and in the acceleration of progress.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="HYPOTHESIS" id="HYPOTHESIS"></a>HYPOTHESIS.</h2>


<p>The object of Life is Growth.</p>

<p>Harmony is the condition favorable
and necessary to growth.</p>

<p>Harmony is the normal condition of
Nature, as proven by the unfailing and
immediate response of growth to its
influence.</p>

<p>Harmonic conditions are created by
the removal of deterrents to growth.</p>

<p>Mind is the first essential in the
growth of Man. A healthy mind insures
a healthy body, and a rational
cultivation of the mind cannot fail to
result in the attainment of the highest
ideals.</p>

<p>All of the processes of Nature are
consistent, and Man and Mind are no
exception to the rule regulating the
growth of other things, except that
their functions as chief assistants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
evolution are unique, and, therefore,
involve greater responsibility.</p>

<p>Unselfishness is necessary to the harmonic
condition in Man, and service to
fellow-man is essential to his growth.</p>

<p>Happiness is the evidence and fruit
of Growth.</p>

<p>There can be no real happiness except
in Growth.</p>

<p>Acts are thoughts materialized; or&mdash;thoughts
realized.</p>

<p>Forethought is an essential aid to
Growth.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the cause of all deterrents
to growth in Man.</p>

<p>Forethought minus Fearthought is
the ideal Mind Equipment.</p>

<p>Fearthought serves no useful purpose;
neither is it a necessary infliction
of intelligent, civilized manhood or
womanhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Culture is necessary to the best
growth.</p>

<p>Mind-culture, or <em>menticulture</em>, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
most important of all the divisions of
culture; for, out of Mind thoughts
spring, and accomplishments grow; but
it has been the last to receive the
same scientific and reasonable attention
that the other cultures have received,
and had not even been given a distinctive
name until <cite>Menticulture</cite> was
published.</p>

<p>In Agriculture and in Horticulture,
plants that seem to have no profitable
nor agreeable use, but are deterrent to
the growth of useful plants, are denominated
"weeds," and are not allowed
to retain root in the same soil;
animals and other living and moving
things that are not serviceable, and can
not be domesticated, are exterminated
from civilized environment; the air
that Man breathes is cleared of poisonous
malaria by draining the swamps in
which the bad air forms; and friction
is minimized in machines, in order that
the energy applied to them may meet
with least resistance, and suffer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
least waste. But no such care is commonly
given to the mind.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the element of friction,
as expressed in anger; it is the
predatory element, as expressed in
waste of energy&mdash;the result of worry;
and it is also the weed element, as
shown by the uselessness of it in any
form. It is, however, permitted to encumber,
muddy and prey upon divinely
ordained forethought, as weeds encumber
good soil, as mud clouds pure water,
and as savage and venomous things
prey upon the comfort and life of animals
useful to Man, and even upon
Man himself.</p>

<p>Man's place in the process of evolution
is that of assistant only. Man
selects, arranges, brings together, separates,
waters, fertilizes, waits upon
and otherwise cultivates Nature; but
he has not been able to add one cell to
growth; neither has he succeeded in
drawing an atom of color from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sunlight and in infusing it into the sap
of any growing thing.</p>

<p>By Man's attention in removing the
deterrents, the skimpy little wild flower
that grows upon the hillsides of China,
that I gathered when I was a boy&mdash;of
less importance than the common field
daisy&mdash;has become the royal chrysanthemum
of the Flower Shows; by
Man's care in the breeding, feeding
and training of the primitive horse
described by Professor Marsh, the almost-human
Kentucky thoroughbred&mdash;the
"Black Beauty" of our pride&mdash;has
been evolved; and the clumsy effort
of the first inventor of steam applied
to machinery has become the
wonderful quadruple-expansion engine
of the present, by the harmonizing adjustment
of parts, and the reduction of
friction to the point of noiseless efficiency,
through the genius of invention.</p>

<p>Mind is the great machine behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all other machines and out of which
all accomplishment comes. Fearthought
and what grows out of it, under
the class names of anger and
worry, are like rust and sand in the
journals, and wear out the bearings of
the machine. They are also like the
impurities in water that cause foaming
in a boiler and prevent the accumulation
of energy. They are productive
of nothing but wear and waste, <em>wear
and waste</em>, as long as they are permitted
to encumber the splendid man-machine
and its source of power.</p>

<p>The creative&mdash;the growing part&mdash;of
Nature never fails to do her part if
the deterrents to growth are removed.
What she does for the growth of plants
and of animals, and for the creation of
power from the use of her forces called
steam and electricity, she will also do
for the growth and development of the
mind of man. If fearthought and its
various expressions are eradicated; or,
more correctly speaking, are not sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and nursed, as they always are, nothing
can prevent Growth and Service
and Happiness from occupying their
own; and if the carbonic-acid-gas of
passion is kept out of the mental atmosphere,
a vitalized, altruistic and
spiritualized energy will take its place.
<em>Good comes to whatever is prepared for it.</em></p>

<p>It is an easy matter to separate
fearthought from forethought if it is
known that they are separable; not by
suppression, nor by process of gradual
repression; because, as long as a
spark of fearthought remains, any excitement
or draft of surprise may revive
the flame to destructive proportions;
but by absolute eradication,&mdash;determination
not to suffer, nor permit,
nor tolerate.</p>

<p>The method of eradication is, by
the way, the method that is easier than
not, as soon as conviction of the possibility
of it is nursed into a belief.</p>

<p><em>Effective methods are always easy
methods.</em></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Repression acknowledges, and therefore
strengthens, the evil to be repressed,
is never-ending and altogether
ineffectual.</p>

<p>Eradication is the simple method
of ceasing to import or admit evil
counsel or report, and is the only effective
method in menticulture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the future is the field in
which growth must take place, the now
or, rather, the immediate-next-future,
is the <em>only</em> time for action. Are you
possessed of fearthought, or anger, or
worry, or suspicion, or jealousy, or
envy, or malice, or indifference at this
moment? No! You cannot be, for
two distinct thoughts cannot occupy
the mind at the same time, and your
thought is occupied with the subject
matter of this hypothesis. The next
time you have any of these poisons
you will have to import them afresh in
response to the invitation of so mean
a liar as Suspicion, or at the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of so silly a coward as Fear. Habit-of-thought-of-evil&mdash;<em>the
devil</em>&mdash;will return
to you for the usual easy conquest,
but newly-acquired knowledge
of his impotency to harm can aid Determination
to resist him until Habit-of-Thought
is no longer Bad-Habit-of-Thought
and will, therefore, no longer
assist in the materialization of the
spook. And then, and <em>only</em> then, will
you be free&mdash;free to grow, eager to
serve, and altogether happy.</p>

<p>All time&mdash;all eternity&mdash;is made up
of a succession of <em>nows</em>. If you are
free in the present <em>now</em>, you may more
easily be free from temptation in the
succeeding <em>nows</em> until emancipation
shall be complete and the very atmosphere
of your freedom shall exorcise
all evil before it can come near enough
to attract your consciousness.</p>

<p>You are free this moment; you can
be free in the succeeding moments;
<em>you can be free forever!</em> <span class="smcap">It is easier
than not!</span></p>

<p>The perfect man is the harmonious
man.</p>

<p>Perfection in man is attained when
he is <em>doing his best</em>.</p>

<p>Symmetry of face or of form, quality
of voice, or strength of mind or muscle
at birth are the responsibility of the
Creator and of progenitors.</p>

<p>The birth of the body of man is
accomplished when it attains consciousness
of its physical requirements.</p>

<p>The birth of the soul of man is
accomplished when he attains consciousness
of what is good, of what his
functions and duties are relative to his
own best growth, and also relative to
his uses and duties as a member of
society.</p>

<p>Man is not fully born until his mind
is conscious of his body and conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of his soul, and knows the functions
and duties of each relative to the best
growth.</p>

<p>Until man is fully born, as described
above, the responsibility of his perfection
or imperfection rests with his
teachers and their teachings.</p>

<p>Everything that man is conscious of
is his teacher.</p>

<p>You are the teacher of every person
who sees or is otherwise conscious of
you or of your example.</p>

<p>It is unmanly, and especially unchristian,
not to seek the greatest possible
enlightenment relative to the
functions and duties in growth, not only
for your own sake, but as an example
for others; and, being enlightened, not
to do all possible to assist growth.</p>

<p>Whoever reads and assents to the
above, takes upon himself the responsibility
of his future growth, and will
be respectable or not-respectable insofar
as he seeks enlightenment and
assists growth, or neglects to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
enlightenment and thereby retards
growth.</p>

<p>Happiness, the evidence, fruit and
reward of growth, rests in self-respect
first, and, incidentally, in the measure
of respect held by others.</p>

<p>No one is respectable who is not
<em>doing his best</em>.</p>

<p>When a man finds fault with the
material with which he has been furnished&mdash;with
his form, with his face,
with his mind, with his muscle, with his
equipment of wealth, or other means or
tools of growth, at the time of his
being fully born, he puts blame upon,
and thereby blasphemes, his Creator, as
well as discredits his progenitors.</p>

<p>Whoever reads, and assents to, the
foregoing is fully born, in that he has
learned and now <em>knows what is best</em>.
The question then is: "What will he
do with it?"</p>

<p>In highly-civilized life it is <em>not-respectable
not to be fully born</em>.</p>

<p>The fully-born is <em>not doing his best</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and is therefore <em>not-respectable when he
suffers himself to retain or cultivate the
habit-of-fearthought</em>.</p>

<p>The fully-born is <em>not doing his best</em>,
and therefore is <em>not-respectable, when he
entertains and nurses worry</em>.</p>

<p>The fully-born is <em>doing his worst
when he allows himself to be angry</em>.</p>

<p>The fully-born is unmanly, especially
unchristian and altogether not-respectable
when he is not doing his best, and
is always a subject for pity, and frequently
a subject for contempt, when
he is doing his worst.</p>

<p>The fully-born-and-entirely-respectable
individual knows that fearthought
is an unprofitable element of forethought,
knows that it can be eliminated
from the habit-of-feeling by persistent,
intelligent habit-of-thought, and, knowing
this, prepares the field of his mind
for unhampered growth by eradicating
all of the expressions of fearthought, as
well as all other deterrents to growth.</p>

<p>The fully-born-and-entirely-respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
individual is the one to whom
come health, strength, memory, inspiration,
love, preferment, altruistic impulses,
and the appreciation necessary
to find the greatest enjoyment in them
all.</p>

<p>The fully-born-and-entirely-respectable
individual needs not symmetry of
form nor beauty of face nor accumulation
of wealth to make him happy,
for the light from within will give grace
to his form, reflect beauty from his
face, and attract all of the things that
constitute wealth.</p>

<p>The fully-born-and-entirely-respectable
condition is the condition that is
easier than not, pleasanter than any,
and in which only true happiness dwells.</p>

<p>Out of the fully-born-and-entirely-respectable
habit-of-being and habit-of-thinking,
nursed within our professedly-altruistic
organizations, will the impulse
spring which will so shape conditions
that unhappiness can no longer exist,
except as the result of perversity.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="PREFATORY_DEFINITIONS" id="PREFATORY_DEFINITIONS"></a>PREFATORY DEFINITIONS.</h2>


<p>Much misunderstanding arises from
the various interpretations of the meaning
of terms. So different are the interpretations
given to some words, that
a large part of the dictionaries is taken
up with synonyms whose varied applications
are nearly as wide apart as the
limits of the greatest misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Many of these different applications
of words are the result of corruptions
of the original meaning, but they are
none the less misleading, and furnish
an excuse for agreeing on specific definitions.</p>

<p>As an example of corrupt uses given
to words that should be held to convey
only a sacred meaning, take the
word "love," as promiscuously applied,
for instance. It should be removed
from all selfishness, and attach only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to such holy application as that implied
by the expression, "God is Love."
In its application to individuals, as in
mother-love, child-love, love between
husband and wife, or between brothers,
it should only have spiritual significance,
unalloyed by any suggestion
of liking, approval, desire, or lust; and
should even extend its mantle to
spread alike over all created things.</p>

<p>Love had already been so corrupted
in its uses in the time of Comte, that
he was impelled to coin a new word to
express unselfishness between brother-men,
and hence gave the word "altruism"&mdash;(other-self)&mdash;to
the world.</p>

<p>"Altruism," also, in its turn, has
suffered by contact with the selfish
habit-of-thought of the present time,
until it does not longer express the
highest quality of love&mdash;the spiritual&mdash;but
rather the socio-commercial quality
that seeks and expects reward of
praise or material emolument.</p>

<p>Although it is some time since "altruism"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was first used&mdash;and it is a word
of most important meaning to sociology&mdash;there
are few who can define it.</p>

<p>Probably the material rush of the
time has allowed little opportunity for
acquaintance with it. It is rarely seen
in the magazines, and almost never in
the daily papers. This is probably the
reason why the author was able to find
only three, out of thirty persons asked,
who could define "altruism." These
thirty were met haphazard, and represented
a fair average of city intelligence.
It follows, by inference, that there is not
as much altruism as there should be in
existence among us, for, if there were,
the word chosen by Comte to express
it would be more widely used and
known.</p>

<p>In presenting a set of definitions,
there is no intention of calling into
question the intelligence of any reader.
The idea was suggested by the wide
difference of understanding of the
meaning of the word "worry." This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
difference of understanding became
apparent in the discussion of <cite>Menticulture</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It was found that many persons
defined "worry" as "any consideration
of the future," whereas only apprehensive
consideration of the future was
intended to be meant by its use in
<cite>Menticulture</cite>.</p>

<p>Reference to the origin of the word
revealed that it was first used to express
the "barking of a small dog,"
probably in contradistinction to the
biting of a large dog. It was first
"worrit," and became "worry," as now,
later on. "Picking" and "nagging"
were its synonyms in slang until they
were taken into the language as sober
expressions.</p>

<p>In the attempt to separate "worry"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>from "forethought," the word "fearthought"
was coined, and hence our
present title, and also the definitions
hereunder, whose object is to render
misunderstanding as nearly impossible
as possible.</p>

<p>Only a few of the words relative to
our treatise are defined&mdash;only such as
have been found to cause discussion in
consideration of the subject.</p>


<h3>GOD.</h3>

<p>No definition of the Christian conception
of God can be adequate. God
is the source of all, in all, and around
all. "The Absolute," "Father," "Creator,"
"Jehovah," "Source" and other
terms are used for euphony and to
express separate God-qualities. Whoever
attempts to define God, shows
pitiful limitations thereby. We may
<em>feel</em> God, but we cannot <em>define</em> God.
<em>Appreciation</em> of God is the measure of
man's possibilities of growth and the
key to power and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPRECIATION.</h3>

<p>Even in its material application,
"appreciation" is a word of greatest
importance, and should mean <em>the
highest form of intelligence</em>. It is commonly
used to express only a simple
knowledge of value, but it should have
a larger significance, by conveying the
idea of fullest cultivation and enjoyment
as well as knowledge.</p>

<p>Wealth, for instance, can be measured
only by appreciation. The child
in appreciating a toy is richer than a
drowning man with a thousand dollars
in gold in his pocket. We will therefore
understand appreciation to mean
<em>knowledge and full cultivation and enjoyment</em>.</p>

<p>"Appreciation" might justly be
given first place in the language, as, in
its spiritual application, it implies the
knowledge of God that gives birth to
Love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Our definition, "knowledge&mdash;or
understanding&mdash;cultivation and full
enjoyment," conveys the largest and
highest meaning of "appreciation,"
but the realization of it is not complete
until every God-expression is included,
even to the smallest wonder of the
universe.</p>

<p>Neglect of the cultivation of appreciation
of <em>everything</em>&mdash;of the commonest
things in our surroundings&mdash;is
loss of opportunity to conserve the
greatest aid to progress and growth;
because, appreciation of lesser things
insures a better appreciation of the
most important things.</p>

<p>Cultivation of appreciation is cultivation
of the germ of all good and the
opening wide of the spiritual flood-gates.
Even the complete, yet simple,
dignity of the Lord's Prayer can be
epitomized within the prayer, <em>Father,
teach Thou us Appreciation</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<h3>LOVE.</h3>

<p>In its pure form, as Christ meant it,
Love makes no distinction between
creatures nor between things; its merit
is in the act&mdash;or thought&mdash;and not in
the object loved.</p>

<p>The divine quality in man, growing
out of appreciation, finds first expression
in love; not the passive principle,
the opposite of hate, but the growing,
active principle, which is constantly
flowing forth from the spiritually
blessed to bathe with warmth of unselfishness
the just and the unjust
alike. Love begets altruism.</p>

<p>As "perfect love casteth out fear,"
so does the eradication of fear insure
the wooing of perfect love.</p>


<h3>ALTRUISM.</h3>

<p>Next in the scale of importance
is Comte's word "altruism," which was
coined to suggest the Christ-like attitude
of unselfish service between fellow-men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
It is, however, as before
stated, now commonly understood to
be the social or business application
of the principle of love which needs
and expects to be reciprocal. Men
were asked to become altruists when
they were asked to "do unto others
as you would that others should do
unto you." Growth towards divinity
is the fruit of perfect altruism. Perfect
Love begets Perfect Altruism.
Christ is the Perfect Altruist.</p>


<h3>SPONTANEOUS ALTRUISM.</h3>

<p>Any degree of altruism is good and
is sure to lead to higher degrees, but
the perfect type is best kept in view
by the use of the qualified form expressed
by the adjective "spontaneous"&mdash;meaning
voluntary, without
reward, except as found in the act
itself. This qualification is almost necessary
to prevent the lowering of the
value of the term, as "perfect" was
required to express Christ-Love, in
contra-distinction to worldly love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3>OPTIMISM.</h3>

<p>Optimism is <em>forethought</em>. Christianity,
pure and undefiled, is perfect
optimism. Christ is the Perfect Optimist.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<h3>FORETHOUGHT.</h3>

<p>"Forethought" is <em>the logical, trustful,
hopeful, Christian, and therefore
stimulating, consideration of the future</em>.</p>

<p>Forethought cannot be contrasted
as the opposite of fearthought for the
same reason that a tree cannot be contrasted
as the opposite of its shadow;
one being the growing, fruit-bearing
substance; and the other being the
unsubstantial, unillumined simulation
of the living reality.</p>


<h3>ENVIRONMENT.</h3>

<p><em>Surroundings which impress themselves
upon the mind and assist to influence
and form character and opinions.</em></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPIRITUAL CEREBRATION.</h3>

<p>Sometimes called unconscious cerebration;
<em>intelligence not derived from
experience</em>; principally obtained during
undisturbed sleep, and, seemingly, supernaturally
clear to consciousness on
awakening in natural manner; Spiritual
Cerebration is man's best partner,
if confidently listened to, heeded and
followed.</p>


<h3>NATURAL SELECTION.</h3>

<p><em>Unconscious physical attraction</em>; assisting
sustenance, protection, development
and reproduction; attribute of all
life.</p>


<h3>DIVINE SELECTION.</h3>

<p><em>Attribute only of Man; distinguishing
Man from the rest of Creation;
exercised in modifying the brute law of
the "survival of the fittest, or strongest,"
by cultivating harmonic conditions
favoring growth and producing happiness;
God's Higher Law of Harmony
executed through Man.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p><em>The evidence and fruit and reward
of growth as involved in Altruism.</em></p>


<h3>NATURE.</h3>

<p>As commonly used, "nature" means
creation apart from man. The accepted
definition is "creation," and as
such includes man and all created
things, and also the processes of creation&mdash;generation,
degeneration and
regeneration&mdash;as involved in growth.
The common use of the word "nature"
is a convenient one, and hence
let us make use of it as meaning <em>creation
other than man</em>.</p>


<h3>EGOCIATION.</h3>

<p>Egociation is, <em>Appreciation of self as
a creation of God and as an instrument
of Altruism</em>&mdash;to be cultivated to its
greatest possibilities in order that it
may render <em>Altruistic service in the execution
of the Higher Law of Harmony</em>.</p>

<p>There are two distinct kinds of <em>ego</em>&mdash;self:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The <em>ego</em> that is physically and
intellectually born only, and whose tendencies
are egotistically selfish, and
therefore, <em>animalesque</em>: And the <em>ego</em> that
enjoys Appreciation, realizes God, loves
spontaneously, understands the Higher
Law of Harmony and serves with enthusiasm
in the execution of the Law
by the exercise of Divine Selection, and
thereby attains True Happiness.</p>

<p>The mental equipment of the unthinking
is dulled by a confusion of
these two <em>egos</em>, and hence they cultivate
egotism, believing it to be <em>Egociation</em>;
as they cultivate <em>fearthought</em>, believing
it to be forethought; and as they tolerate
license, believing it to be an attribute of
liberty.</p>

<p>The desirability of separating the
lower, or animal, self from the Higher
Self, warrants the coining of a term,
sufficiently new to attract attention and
sufficiently allied to well-known words
to explain itself. With this object in
view I have empirically selected a combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of <em>ego</em> and <em>appreciation</em>, and in
so doing, have coined the euphonious
term <em>Egociation</em> as an antithesis of
"egotism," especially useful in inculcating
a general understanding of the
Higher Law of Harmony and in securing
recognition of the place of the
Higher Self within the Law.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of Egociation, man
recognizes and asserts an <em>individuality</em>,
or <em>responsibility</em>, as a part of the whole,
the result of appreciation, opposed to
<em>personality</em> or <em>separateness</em>, which is an
attribute of egotism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Words that carry good suggestion
with them are less liable to do harm by
being variously understood than those
that convey bad suggestion. These
latter should be defined in such a manner
as to clearly suggest their badness;
in fact, war should be waged upon them
by every possible means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>EGOTISM.</h3>

<p>"Egotism" is <em>separation from God</em>.
The fruit of egotism is selfishness.</p>


<h3>SELFISHNESS.</h3>

<p>In the list of the deterrents, selfishness
holds bottom place. Self-forethought,
self-carefulness, self-culture,
and self-respect, are in no way related
to selfishness, but are provision of
strength towards useful purposes. Selfishness
is the mark of animal origin.
We will therefore define it as <em>relic of
animalism remaining in man</em>.</p>

<p>Selfishness is the opposite of altruism.
While a suggestion of altruism
is found in some animals, especially in
dogs, it is not an animal characteristic.
Selfishness is the predominant animal
trait and therefore excuses the otherwise
unkindly comparison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>FEAR.</h3>

<p>Fear is also a relic of animalism,
and a child of selfishness&mdash;a deformed
child of an ill-formed parent. It is
not a physical condition, but simply an
expression of fearthought. We will
therefore define "fear" as <em>an expression
of fearthought</em>.</p>


<h3>FEARTHOUGHT.</h3>

<p>"Fearthought" is <em>the self-imposed
or self-permitted suggestion of inferiority</em>.
It is both a <em>cause</em> and an <em>effect</em> of
selfishness. It is the "tap-root of evil."</p>

<p>"Fearthought" was coined by the
author in order, if possible by suggestion,
to separate from divinely ordained
forethought any element of apprehension
or weakness that might be
masquerading under the name of forethought
in the minds of the unthinking.</p>


<h3>WORRY.</h3>

<p>"Worry" is <em>fearthought in contradistinction
to forethought</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANGER.</h3>

<p>"Anger" is <em>the brutal and self-inflicting
expression of disapproval</em>&mdash;brutal,
because it is ungodly, unchristian
and unaltruistic; <em>self-inflicting</em>, because
the ill-effect of it reacts upon the
person enangered.</p>

<p>There can be no "righteous anger."
Disapproval there must be, because
man has been endowed with the faculty
of <em>Divine Selection</em>, and thereby
shows a divinity denied to all other
living things whose preferences are
called in Science "natural selection."
Disapproval in the interest of harmony&mdash;<em>Divine
Selection</em>&mdash;and disapproval
in the creation of discord&mdash;anger&mdash;are,
the one holy, and the
other unholy, uses of the faculty of
selection.</p>

<p>There may be, then, <em>righteous disapproval</em>,
but there never can be "righteous
anger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>ENVY.</h3>

<p>"Envy" is <em>anger of non-possession</em>.</p>

<p>"Envy" is sometimes wrongly used
to express appreciation, as, "I envy
you your good fortune," but we will
give it the one meaning of "anger of
non-possession."</p>


<h3>JEALOUSY.</h3>

<p>"Jealousy" is "the homage that inferiority
pays to merit";<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or, <em>recognition
or confession of inferiority</em>; or, <em>fearthought</em>.</p>


<h3>TAP-ROOT.</h3>

<p>"Tap-root" is "the chief root." It is
the main support of the tree, of nearly
the size of the trunk, and without
which the tree must fall and die. The
tap-root strikes deep into the soil, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the surface-roots reach out along the
surface. For example; egotism is the
tree of evil, either selfishness or fearthought
is the tap-root, and anger and
worry in all their phases are the surface
roots of the tree. The tree is known
by its fruits, which are, separation,
paralysis, disease, unhappiness and
death.</p>


<h3>TROUBLE.</h3>

<p>Trouble does not really exist. Fearthought
of trouble is as near as one
ever gets to the condition, for the reason
that whatever has come has already
ceased to exist, except in the memory.
The reason for so fine a distinction is
made clear under the caption of "The
Impotence of Pain," and is emphasized
in order to place merited responsibility
on fearthought. What is called
"trouble," however, can be defined as
<em>unwelcome conditions</em>, but, if analyzed,
the chief elements of the "conditions"
will be found to be <em>fearthought of still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
more unwelcome conditions</em>. The tap-root,
then, of trouble is fearthought.</p>


<h3>PESSIMISM.</h3>

<p>Pessimism is <em>fearthought</em>. Pessimism
is the devil.</p>


<h3>NERVOUSNESS.</h3>

<p>Nervousness is generally an <em>effect</em>
and not a <em>cause</em>. It is the immediate
or reflex result of fearthought.</p>


<h3>TEMPERAMENT.</h3>

<p>Like "nervousness," so-called, "temperament"&mdash;habit-of-feeling&mdash;is
generally
an effect and not a cause; and
is frequently used as an excuse for self-indulged
weaknesses.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_VALUE_OF_SIMILE" id="THE_VALUE_OF_SIMILE"></a>THE VALUE OF SIMILE.</h2>


<p>Christ taught almost entirely by
parable.</p>

<p>Apropos of the value of simile is
an experiment about which I have
recently heard.</p>

<p>An experimenter wished to measure
in some way the strength of certain
vibrations and their effect upon vibratory
things. A large steel comb, such
as is used in music-boxes to produce
sounds, was constructed. Each tooth
was made as nearly as possible just
like every other tooth. They not only
seemed to measure alike, but when set
in motion the vibrations seemed to be
alike to the sense of hearing.</p>

<p>There was also constructed a huge
tuning-fork, large enough to be struck
with a bar of iron, and whose vibrations,
when it was struck, came forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in big undulating waves like the pealing
of a temple bell.</p>

<p>The object of the experiment was
to observe, through the effect of powerful
vibrations on the teeth of the resonant
comb, a possible difference, too
slight to be measured by calipers or by
striking the teeth separately. The
sound-waves, coming alike to all, would
affect all alike unless there should be
a difference in the receptivity of the
teeth owing to differing density of
metal, size, or some other condition
not measurable by other means. By
listening attentively near to the comb,
the effect of the vibrations on the separate
teeth could be heard.</p>

<p>The tuning-fork was placed about
forty feet away from the steel comb,
and was struck a heavy blow with the
iron bar. Only three of the twelve
teeth vibrated in response. The others
were not in sympathy. <em>They did not
hear the sound.</em></p>

<p>I did not see the experiment, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
will serve to illustrate the value of
simile.</p>

<p>All knowledge is measured by comparison.
The most effective teaching
is done through parable or simile. A
so-called magnetic orator or writer
reaches his hearers or readers by aid
of apt simile. In this the orator has
the advantage. If one simile does not
convey the point he wishes to make, he
tries another and yet another until he
has detected sympathetic signs of approval
in the majority of his audience.
If there are present a hundred listeners,
it may require ten stories or ten
similes to reach the entire hundred, as
there may be ten kinds of interest or
sympathy present to be reached.
Farmers and gardeners may not be
familiar with the terms that describe
the experience of the mariner; mechanics
may not understand the language of
the counting room or of the various
exchanges; and men may not appreciate
the special accomplishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sympathies, weaknesses or foibles of
women. Each individual is a separate
tooth or string in the instrument
called society. Heredity and environment
have tempered and shaped each
individual differently from his fellows.
Truth is always the same, but the
vibrations that carry it must be regulated
to suit the conditions and understandings
of each person, or group of
persons, to be harmonized by it.</p>

<p>In an attack upon offensive and evil
things, offensive similes are best employed.
It is an application of the
principle that a thief can best catch a
thief. The object of this little book is
to wage war upon fearthought and its
brood of evil children. This is the
excuse for writing under such offensive
captions as "Don't Be a Sewer," and
"Thou Shalt Not Strike a Woman,"
and also such ungrammatical caption
as "I Can't <em>Not</em> Do It."</p>

<p>It is the opinion of the author that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
we are in the habit of taking evil too
seriously. Evil is usually ridiculous,
and while it thrives under the stimulation
of serious consideration, it cannot
stand ridicule. Shrewd politicians
know this, and hence depend more upon
the political cartoon to kill the political
enemy, than upon all the reading
matter possible to be printed.</p>

<p>What the terms "God," "Appreciation,"
"Mother," "Love," "Altruism,"
"Egociation," "Forethought," "Happiness,"
etc., stand for, should be
reverenced and glorified; while the
devil, egotism, selfishness, fearthought,
anger and worry, and all of their
various expressions, should be ridiculed
out of respectability.</p>

<p>There is no intent to make vulgar
excuses for the method of presentation
of the simple and aged truths which
are the subject of the present book.
For the same reason that I have asked
my readers to agree with me as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
meaning of terms in connection with
the discussion, I ask them to allow me
to state my reasons for the method of
the presentation, if it should seem unusual
and, perhaps, undignified.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="no-break"><a name="ANALYSIS_OF_FEAR" id="ANALYSIS_OF_FEAR"></a>ANALYSIS OF FEAR.</h2>


<p>Professor Angelo Mosso, the eminent
physiologist of Turin, Italy, who
has experimented with the condition
and results of fear to a greater extent
than any one else that I know of, has
published a volume entitled "Fear."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Professor Mosso writes of much regarding
fear that we can all corroborate
from personal experience as to the
uncomfortableness of the emotion, and
also informs us of much that is instructive
as to the baleful effects of the
mischief it produces upon the tissues
of the body. He states that, unconsciously
or consciously, the effect of
fear is found to be disarrangement,
which allows or causes inflammation,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>fever and other unhealthy conditions
that are favorable to the nesting of the
microbes of special diseases, such as
are sometimes found in the air or in
the water that we take in, and which
are ever waiting for a chance to nest
and breed.</p>

<p>An eminent English physician has
also communicated to a leading English
magazine a belief that fear directly
attacks the individual molecules of the
body and causes a disarrangement, a
relaxing, a letting-go condition of the
molecules in their relation to adjoining
molecules, and that the relaxed condition
is that in which disease originates.
He states that there are means of communication
within the body that are as
direct and distinct as are the wires
that convey the electric fluid from
point to point, and that they connect
the brain or nervous centers with each
pair of molecules. By these means the
sense of fear travels, weak or strong, in
response to every pulse of its activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Within our visible experience, we
know how completely the emotion of
fear, or any of its various expressions
can upset the stomach, suspend the
appetite and even cause instant death.
So evident are the bad effects of fear,
that it is necessary only to refer to
them before suggesting a remedy; but
there are some powerful illustrations
that are interesting, and which will be
found under the caption of "Baleful
Effects of Fear."</p>

<p>In this connection, what we are most
interested in is, how to rid ourselves of
the habit of fear. Fear is not a physical
thing. It is the result of fearthought,
and, being fearthought, has no
more substance than other thought.</p>

<p>In animals it is an attribute of instinct,
and is a wise provision of protection.
In the human young, it is not
so. In the helplessness of human f&oelig;tal
existence and infancy, we find a perfectly
clean, but wonderfully impressionable,
thought-matrix, into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are to be impressed the suggestions
whose sum constitutes the intelligence
in men which takes the place of instinct
in animals.</p>

<p>Fear is no constituent part of the
composition of this thought-matrix.
Susceptibility to fearthought, as it is
susceptible to any and all suggestions,
is the nearest approach to inherent infliction
of fear that the unfolding soul
is burdened with. If the race-habit-of-thought
were indelibly pock-marked
by fear, and stamped its roughness on
the thought-matrix of all mankind,
there would be no one free from it; but,
as many are born into, and live, a life
of great strength and courage, free
from any taint of fearthought, this assumption
is disproved, and is as absurd
as would be the assumption that man
must always do whatever, and only
what, his ancestors did.</p>

<p>All of the fear-impressions received
are the result of either pre-natal or post-natal
suggestion. It is within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
power of parents and nurses to keep
the delicate susceptibility of their
charges free from the curse of fearthought;
or to cause or allow it to be
scared and bruised by the claws of the
demon.</p>

<p>President G. Stanley Hall, of Clarke
University, Editor in Chief of the <cite>American
Journal of Psychology</cite>, and Dr. Colin
A. Scott, Professor of Psychology and
Child Study at the Cook County Normal
School, Chicago, Ill., U. S. A., have
rendered greatest service to humanity
by searching out and analyzing fears in
children, exposing the absurdity of
them, showing the sources from which
foolish fears are derived, and thereby
dragging from ambush the worst enemy
of mankind, whose strength is developed
by means of secret toleration, but
can easily be overcome if uncovered.</p>

<p>The method of securing information
was by means of the <em>questionaire</em>,
the answers to which, although unsigned
and unidentifiable, and savoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of exaggeration or romance, furnish
splendid texts in a crusade against the
toleration of the habit-of-fear in a civilized
community. One can scarcely
imagine, before reading the answers to
the fear <em>questionaire</em>, the unreasonable
and absurd fears that warp the lives
and ruin the health of many of the
people among whom we move, and by
whom, in some measure, we and our
children are unconsciously influenced.</p>

<p>If it were the community-habit-of-thought
that fear was an unnecessary
thing and an evil thing, and not respectable
and not Christian, many of
these fears would not exist, owing to
the proneness of all persons to imitation
and their acceptance of community-of-habit-thought
as law and gospel.
Fear is a very insidious thing. It will
enter the smallest opening, and ferment,
and increase, and permeate whatever
it attacks, if it be permitted foothold
in the least degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>We have too little time in life personally
to investigate all of the causes
of things that are pertinent to our living
and working, or to learn the reason
for their leading to observed results.
We are indebted to Professor Mosso,
Dr. Hall, Dr. Scott and other painstaking
scientists, for observing the
habits of our enemies, and for giving
the results of their observations in such
agreeable forms as are the intimate and
frank analyses of fear given in Professor
Mosso's book and other treatises
on the subject; but what we are most
interested in is, how to kill or how to
escape fearthought within ourselves
and, ultimately, how to protect our
children against the evil.</p>

<p>To digress somewhat, and as an excuse
for using the terms of parable and
homely experience instead of the terms
of science: It is said that the use of
alum for the settling of impurities out
of water was an old housewife's remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for a very long time before any
scientist studied the chemical change
that effected the result.</p>

<p>The old housewives knew by experience,
as well as did the doctors, that
alum <em>would</em> "settle" water, but it was
left to the latter to say <em>why</em> it did so.
We are, therefore, mainly indebted to
a chance discovery, and to the preservation
of the formula by housewives,
for our ability to purify water by means
of alum.</p>

<p>In the same manner we have discovered,
perhaps by accident, that certain
suggestions will purify our minds,
by eliminating special fears by which
we have been dominated. We also
have learned by experiment that all
fear is eliminable by use of sufficiently
powerful suggestion made to fit the
particular fear experimented against.
I <em>know that the deterrent passions can
be eradicated</em>; and, <em>easier than not</em>.
Others <em>know</em> this also, and are living
lives of beautiful strength, freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and happiness, who once were slaves
to fearthought; and many such there
already are, and their number is increasing
very rapidly under the influence
of the observation of unfailing,
profitable results in consequence.</p>

<p>If we <em>know</em> that anything <em>can be done</em>,
it is not vitally essential that we should
know <em>why</em> it is possible.</p>

<p>Experience, in conveying the suggestion,
has taught that there is <em>some</em> way
to reach, and to dispel, any special fear.</p>

<p>Science will some time, undoubtedly,
be able to tell us just how to treat each
form of fear in a scientific manner, but
in the meantime we <em>know</em> that it is
possible to cure all of the separate
forms of fear by rooting out the basic
fear&mdash;the fear of death&mdash;and by conveying
the all-powerful suggestion that
all fear is needless and unprofitable.</p>

<p>In the last chapter I stated that the
bad effects of fear were so well known
to every one that it was not necessary
to dwell upon them, but second thought
suggests stating a few special cases that
have been told me by physician friends
who are interested in the lay experiments
I am making.</p>

<p>In the Southern States of the United
States of America, where the black
race comes into closest touch with
Caucasian civilization under conditions
of free expression, is probably
the best place to study fear and its
opposite, chivalrous courage.</p>

<p>Dr. William E. Parker, of the
Charity Hospital of New Orleans, was
once called to attend a big negro who
had been brought in by the ambulance,
and whom the students in charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ambulance had frightened nearly to
death by telling that he was badly
wounded in the stomach, and would
probably die.</p>

<p>The negro was big and burly and
black, and yet, livid with fear. Both
pulse and temperature indicated serious
trouble within, and the convulsive
tremors that shook him from time to
time revealed a state of collapse that
might end in death at any time.
There was no outward flow of blood,
but the probable inward flow seemed
more dangerous in consequence.</p>

<p>The account of the case, as related
by the students, told of a shooting
affray, in which the negro had been hit
in the abdomen, as evidenced by a bullet-hole
in his clothing.</p>

<p>Dr. Parker began an examination
by ordering the clothing of the
patient removed, and during which a
bullet, much flattened, fell upon the
floor. This bullet had done no serious
injury, of course, but there might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
have been two shots and two bullets,
one of which had penetrated
the body, and hence the bullet that
fell upon the floor caused no special
attention, till search had been made
in vain for a hole in the skin. Complete
examination revealed the fact
that the negro had been hit, but
that the bullet had struck a button,
causing a bruised place behind the button,
but had lodged in the clothing, in
harmless inertia.</p>

<p>As the doctor held up the bullet, and
told the patient of the slight extent of his
injury and the wonder of his escape,
good, warm blood returned to the livid
countenance, the pulse and the temperature
assumed their normal condition,
a grateful sparkle lit up the almost
glassy eyeballs, and the broadest
possible grin spread over the face of
the erstwhile dying man.</p>

<p>The negro got down from the operating-table,
arranged his clothing, and,
after apologizing for the trouble he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had caused, and after thanking the
doctor and the students for their attentions,
went out into the street as
well as ever. He had been, half an
hour before, at death's door.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry A. Veazie, one of the
student-heroes of the yellow-fever epidemic
of 1878, who had splendid opportunity
to witness the effects of fear
during an epidemic, asserts that fear is
a certain cause of attack of yellow fever.</p>

<p>I will say, parenthetically, in the way
of right information relative to the
South, that there has been no epidemic
since 1878&mdash;twenty years; that it has
been proven that yellow fever does not
originate in any part of the United
States, and that it is very effectively
barred out at quarantine, or, if accidentally
admitted, that it is easily
killed by present means of treatment,
and that an epidemic is no longer mentioned
as a possibility&mdash;only as quite a
remote memory&mdash;in New Orleans, or
elsewhere in the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Veazie's story is corroborated
by an able brochure on "The
Influence of Fear in Disease," by the
much-beloved, the late Dr. William H.
Holcomb, of New Orleans; and, so
helpful are the suggestions contained
in it, that I have secured the privilege
from the Purdy Publishing Company,
of Chicago, of reprinting largely from
it, and have added the matter copied
as "Appendix A," to this volume.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Veazie also called my attention
to the unusual fatality attending
what are called "frog-accidents."
Train-handlers and yardmen employed
on railroads are very liable to these
"frog-accidents." The frog is that
part of a switch where the rails come
together, forming a "V." In running
about recklessly, as a train-man generally
does, he sometimes catches the sole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>of a boot in the "V," and wedges it
in so tightly that the foot cannot be
withdrawn. If a locomotive, or a car,
happen to be coming towards him, and
cannot be stopped in time, cutting off
of the foot or the leg by the wheels
upon the rails is a certain result.</p>

<p>If it were done instantly, and without
a foreknowledge of the owner of
the leg or foot, the chances of recovery
would be almost assured, because of the
present skill of surgery and the efficacy
of known antiseptics; but with the few
moments of foreknowledge of the impending
accident, the poison of fearthought
has time to so unnerve the system,
relax the tissues, and itself disease
the body by shock, that the wounding
usually results in death.</p>

<p>There is probably no situation in
which a person can be placed where
the conditions are more horrible than
to be wedged between the rails, and to
see an eighty-ton locomotive rolling on
to him with irresistible weight. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
condemned to be hanged cannot be as
fearful, for the reason that the condemned
has been led gradually to contemplate
the possibility of death by this
means, and has come to expect it with
a certain amount of complacency. The
terror of the "frog-accident" comes
with the suddenness of its possibility
and the helplessness of the situation.
It is like an ice-water bath thrown on a
sweating person. It is the icy hand of
death come to clutch at the throat of
warmest hope and fondest affections.
As such, it must be fearful; but, to the
person habituated to <em>fear</em> fear, through
knowing the deadly effect of it, the
emotion can be prepared for, greatly
modified and possibly counteracted, by
a prearrangement with the emotional
self&mdash;that which Hudson calls the
"subjective mind."</p>

<p>To be effective in case of surprise,
the preparation must come from the
habit-of-feeling, "<em>I must not be afraid;
I must not be afraid.</em>" No matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the surprise, the emotional self must
instantly assert, through habit, "<em>I must
not be afraid</em>."</p>

<p>I have not had experience with "frog-accidents"
to test the efficacy of my
theory of schooled suggestion, but I
have been subject to surprises that
have been quite as fearful. As it happened,
the incident I speak of was not
perilous, but it had all the appearance
of being so to me, when I was awakened
from sleep, in a hotel in New
York City, by suffocation, to find my
room full of smoke that poured in
through the transom and through the
cracks of the door which was my only
means of escape.</p>

<p>My room was on the fifth floor of
the hotel, and the house had the reputation
of being a "fire-trap."</p>

<p>As soon as my reasoning-self had
time to take in the situation, the probability
of being burned to death seemed
almost certain; but before that happened&mdash;that
is, before the reasoning-self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had analyzed the situation&mdash;the
habit-of-thought self had asserted
many times, and constantly, "You <em>must
not be afraid! you must not be afraid</em>";
and, as a result, I was <em>not afraid</em>; and
the calm of the moment allowed me to
measure chances and arrange expedients,
as if there were no danger imminent.</p>

<p>It was a case of much smoke and
little fire, but there were those in the
hotel who were made very ill by the
fright of it.</p>

<p>If I had always been free from the
emotion of fear, and had not been a
sorry victim to it in some special
forms, "natural temperament" could
be urged as a cause of the calm I
enjoyed during the incident related
above; but such is not the case. I
have been subjected to shocks of various
kinds, incident to an adventurous
life, that have been powerful impressions
for evil upon my emotional self,
and it is personal experience of cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and relief that I am giving in support
of my theory.</p>

<p>The experience of Mr. George Kennan,
the Siberian traveler, and brilliant
writer and lecturer, relative to
fear and its cure, is singularly like my
own, and was related to me in an exchange
of personal confidences, last
year.</p>

<p>The <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> for May, 1897,
contains an excellent account of Mr.
Kennan's case, and I am permitted by
the publishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin
&amp; Company, to reprint it; which I
have done under Appendix "B."</p>

<p>Fear is rarely general as related
to different causes for fearthought.
I have been told of a case of specific
fear that is interesting because of its
unreasonableness. It was the case of
a filibuster who had been on several
raids where death was the almost certain
penalty for being caught, and
where the chances of being caught
were almost certain. On the frontier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
our subject was known as a dare-devil,
not afraid of anything, and yet
he was always in mortal terror of a dark
room. In infancy he had been scared
into obedience by tales of goblins in the
dark, and he had never rid himself of
their influence. Anything on earth he
could see held no terror for him, but
he could not see the phantoms he created
in the dark, and was therefore a
slave to fear of them. It is probable
that the bravado of his active life was
partly caused by the desire to "average
up" on courage, and, if so, the
baleful effects of fear in this case were
very far-reaching and destructive to
the peace of society.</p>

<p>General experience teaches that
whenever you find a bully, you find a
yellow streak of cowardice somewhere
in his composition; and, more than
probable, bravado is assumed by him,
in order to "square" himself with his
own self-respect.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="HOW_TO_ELIMINATE_FEAR" id="HOW_TO_ELIMINATE_FEAR"></a>HOW TO ELIMINATE FEAR.</h2>


<p>It has been observed that the rooting
out of any particular phase of fearthought,
weakens the strength of all of
the other phases. For instance, suppression
of <em>anger</em> and <em>worry</em> tends to
suppress all suspicion, and even fear
itself, while special attack upon the
fearthought called envy will perceptibly
diminish the tendency to jealousy
and avarice. There seems to be
such close relationship between all of
the forms of fearthought, that whatever
affects one, affects all.</p>

<p>Fear of death undoubtedly underlies
all fearthought. Fear of poverty, fear
of accident, fear of sickness, all reach
further than these calamities, to the
possibility of death resulting from them.
In this way we can trace all expressions
of fear, either directly or indirectly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
through the different forms of
selfness, to fearthought of death.</p>

<p>In <cite>Menticulture</cite> I suggested the
elimination of <em>anger</em> and <em>worry</em> as the
roots of all the evil passions. On
page 17, however, I gave "fear" as
the tap-root of the evil emotions, including
anger and worry, and stated
my reason for attacking the surface
roots best known and associated together,
rather than the tap-root itself.
It was because I believed at the time
<cite>Menticulture</cite> was written, with people
in general, that fear was a constituent
weakness of all consciousness, and only
expressions of it were eliminable.</p>

<p>I find in my later experience in practice,
however, and in conveying the
suggestion to others, that fear itself is
possible to be rooted out by the force
of counter-suggestion of one sort or another,
and that there is no mental habit
or impression that cannot be counteracted
by some other more powerful
habit or impression, and that it is best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to attack the bottom cause of all weaknesses
at once, and thereby wage warfare
upon their innermost citadel.</p>

<p>As fearthought is the parent of all
the evil emotions, so is fear of death
the first of all the causes of fearthought.</p>

<p>It is not a difficult matter to eliminate
the fear of death. It is first necessary
to do away with any dread of a lifeless
human body. There are few who feel
dread of the flesh of animals as they
see it hanging in the stalls of the butchers.
There is no more reason to have
a feeling of fear in connection with the
sight of dead human flesh than there
is to feel uncomfortable in the presence
of the flesh of a lifeless lamb or a
lifeless chicken.</p>

<p>There have lived people who were
as accustomed to seeing human flesh
exposed in butchers' shops as we are
accustomed to see the flesh of animals
so exposed, and there is an engraving
of a cannibal meat-stall in Huxley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"Man's Place in Nature," copied from
an old book of travel to the coast of
Africa, which Mr. Huxley offers authoritatively.</p>

<p>The subject may seem to be a grewsome
one to many readers, and reference
to the customs of cannibals may
shock their supersensitive habits of
thought, but the object is sufficient justification.
Such may, however, soothe
their injured feelings by remembering
that our meat-selling and meat-eating
customs seem as inhuman to many
Buddhists as do the customs of cannibals
to us.</p>

<p>If we value essentials impartially,
soul and mind count above everything,
and tissue which they once animated
counts for nothing when they have left
it, no matter what have been the associations,
especially if dread of the
dead tissue inspires emotions that are
detrimental to the welfare of soul or
mind.</p>

<p>My object in suggesting a systematic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
reversal of our feeling towards lifeless
human flesh is because it is a basic
cause of fear. Remove this dread, and
half of the terror of death is removed
with it.</p>

<p>In this connection, the suggestion
should be urged, that separation&mdash;as
in death&mdash;is unessential as compared
with the privilege of having known a
beloved one, and that appreciation and
gratitude should always outweigh regret
in relation to an inevitable change.</p>

<p>All of the observed processes of
nature teach that every normal change
is for the better, and the change called
death is as normal as the change called
birth. The full term of human life
is but a pin-point in the great span of
evolution. How unreasonable it is to
protest the measurement of the breadth
of a pin-point with Him who doeth all
things well!</p>

<p>Life is like the ticking of a clock;
each passing of the pendulum may be
a day or a year; when the clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
strikes, one period only is ended, but
a new period is also begun. Why
mourn at the striking of the clock! A
new and happier hour has begun.
Why mourn the passing on of a beloved
one! For to Christian, or to
Buddhist, as well as to all sentient beings,
a new and a better life has then
begun.</p>

<p>The attitude towards the separation
called death should be such as to induce
the thought, and even the expression,
"Pass on, beloved; enter into
the better state which all of the processes
of nature teach are the result of
every change; it will soon be my time
to follow; my happiness at your preferment
attend you; my love is blessed
with that happiness; and what you
have been to me remains, and will
remain forever. Amen."</p>

<p>Sorrow was dignified by Christ. He
has been wrongfully called "The Man
of Sorrow." His sorrow was for the
evils which men suffered, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was caused by any of the beneficent
decrees of the Father. Protest against
the decrees of the Father is blasphemy.
Some forms of sorrow are blasphemy.</p>

<p>Sorrow and optimism do not go
together. Christ was (and is) the
Supreme Optimist, and taught nothing
but optimism. Tears do not always
express sorrow. Wherein tears express
selfishness, especially in the form
of anger, they are bad. Wherein tears
are free from selfishness, they may do
no great harm. In such case, what
may seem to be sorrow may be an
expression of loving sympathy, and,
as such, may be good.</p>

<p>Without careful analysis of the
quality of the emotion, love may be
thought to be righteous cause for fearthought.
This is a vicious thought.
Nothing is righteous that is harmful,
and fearthought is harmful. Love,
without any element of fearthought in
it, is infinitely better than love that is
tinctured with fearthought. Forethought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is the necessary accompaniment
of perfect love, but fearthought
is its enemy.</p>

<p>Separation can be made to gladden
love through self-sacrifice. Separation&mdash;as
in death&mdash;can be made to gladden
love by supreme self-sacrifice to the
beloved one who is preferred by death,
and thereby made to disarm that underlying
fear of all fears&mdash;the fear of
death.</p>

<p>If, however, the fear of lifeless
human flesh is eliminated, the fear of
death itself will be found to be greatly
modified. From this point the elimination
of special pet fears, whether of
the individual or of the community
sort, will become an easy matter, as
the greater is but the sum of the lesser.</p>

<p>In looking for means with which to
attack so great an enemy as fear, either
in one's self or in another, any weapon
is a good weapon that is found to be
effective. Logic is more respectable,
but such is the foolishness of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
forms of fear that ridicule is more
often effective. Appeal to honor, self-respect,
love, logic, ridicule, and to <em>fear
itself</em>, may be had in so worthy a cause
as the vanquishing of the arch-enemy
of growth and happiness.</p>

<p>Old soldiers sometimes admit that
their courage in battle has been the
result of their fear of seeming to be
cowards. When the far-reaching and
poisonous effect of the evil of fearthought
is properly understood, and
the possibility of its elimination generally
believed in, people will be <em>afraid</em>
to be afraid&mdash;afraid of ridicule and
criticism, as well as afraid of evil and
unhealthful effects. The cure will have
been hom&oelig;opathic, in that like has
been employed to cure (or kill) like.</p>

<p>Logic is the most rational weapon,
but ridicule is sharper. Logic may not
cure a robust woman of the woman-habit-of-thought
that a mouse is a fearsome
thing, but reference to the fact
that it is ridiculous for a five-foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
woman to be afraid of a two-inch
mouse may effect the result, especially
when it is known that the mouse is
more afraid of the woman, according
to his capacity for fear, than it is possible
for the woman to be afraid of
the mouse.</p>

<p>Acquaintance is another effective
cure. It may not be necessary that all
afflicted ones should serve an apprenticeship
at undertaking in order to be
cured of fear of a lifeless human body,
but if the fear of a corpse cannot be
eradicated by other means, it is worth
while to do that or <em>anything else</em>, no
matter how uncanny or disagreeable,
in order to accomplish the object.
So necessary is the eradication of
the germ principle of fear to the cultivation
of growth and happiness, that if
it is found that fear of the lifeless
human body cannot be cured otherwise,
even a real apprenticeship in a hospital
dissecting-room would be a profitable
expedient as a last resort. To seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the acquaintance of fearsome insects
and animals, through close observation
and study of their habits, is better than
to suffer harm from a needless prejudice
against them.</p>

<p>Cure of the fear of one dreaded insect
or reptile is sure to modify the
fear of all other things dreaded, so that
the difficult part of the cure is acquiring
the belief that it is possible, and making
the resolve to attempt it.</p>

<p>If parents realized the full importance
of the eradication of fearthought
from the minds of their children, they
would stop immediately all other occupation,
and rest not nor be content
until the germ of fearthought in their
children had been located and killed;
and those skilled in such search and
cure would become the physicians most
in demand.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="HOW_TO_CURE_SPECIAL_FORMS_OF" id="HOW_TO_CURE_SPECIAL_FORMS_OF"></a>HOW TO CURE SPECIAL FORMS OF
FEAR.</h2>


<p>Exciting interest in the intrinsic beauties
and usefulness of things thought
to be disagreeable or dreadful, is an excellent
way of curing fear of them.</p>

<p>I once had an opportunity of experimenting
with this method of curing
particular fears by testing it on a
mother and children whose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête noir</i>
was a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>I had seen them at the World's
Columbian Exposition, wrapt in the
enjoyment of the great displays of fireworks
that were operated on the lake
front of the Exposition grounds each
evening. I also happened to be provided
with statistics, showing that the
chance of being struck by lightning was
only one in a great many thousand, and
that if one were to seek to be struck, he
would have to wait about ten thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
years for his average turn. I recalled
the greater real beauty of the natural
fireworks of the summer season, and
their comparative harmlessness. This
was the logic of it, and modified somewhat
the attitude of the children, as
well as the fear of the mother, relative
to lightning and thunder; but the real
cure came through appreciative suggestion
and acquaintance.</p>

<p>On the approach of a storm wherein
lightning might be expected, and even
before it was visible, the mother had
been in the habit of assuming a frightened
expression, of gathering the children
together, of cowering in a corner,
and sometimes in a closet, in fear and
trembling, until the storm had passed.
From infancy the children had been in
the habit of associating something
fearful with the idea of lightning and
thunder, and had never had a chance
to observe their beauties.</p>

<p>I started in to correct the bad impressions,
and to teach the attractiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of storm phenomena, by calling
out, on the approach of a storm, somewhat
in this wise: "Oh! children, do
you remember the beautiful fireworks
at the Exposition? Come here quick!
let's watch; we are going to have something
ten times more beautiful, and,
oh! such big booms and bangs. Watch
now! ah! that wasn't much, but keep
a-watching and we'll have some beauties.
Crash! bang! blizzard! My! but
wasn't that a beauty? Watch sharp,
now, or you'll miss the best one,&mdash;what!
afraid? Why, Alice, afraid of a beautiful
thing like that! Nonsense! Come
here, dear, and sit in my lap and watch
out sharp, and then you <em>can't</em> be afraid.
There! that's a little lady. Splendid! I
reckon you know how to enjoy something
beautiful, as well as any one.
Boom, boom, boom! Did you ever hear
anything so grand? Great big drums up
yonder. I wonder what sort of a Fourth
of July they are having? Wouldn't
World's-Fair fireworks seem tame beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
this? And think of it!&mdash;they don't
cost a cent, and they are clearing the
atmosphere so that the sun will shine
brighter to-morrow than it ever did.
It will shine for us, and for the plants,
and for the butterflies. My! but aren't
we lucky to have good eyes and good
ears when such things are going on!
and don't we pity the poor little blind
and deaf children! Does lightning
sometimes strike people and kill them?
Why, yes, once in a great, great long
while; but when it does, they say it is
the pleasantest sensation possible.
Don't you mind when you have pleasant
shivers, what a delightful feeling it
is? Well, they say being struck by
lightning is like that&mdash;only more so. I
have never had the experience of
being killed by lightning, of course,
but when my turn to enter the next life
comes, I hope it will be that way; but
the chances of being that lucky are
very slim. Somebody, some great
schoolmaster that knows almost everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
has calculated that if a man
wanted to be struck by lightning he
would probably have to wait about ten
thousand years. That is too long. Life
is delightful as it is; but if I had to wait
even a thousand years or even an hundred
years more for my promotion that
way, I think I would rather choose a
more common and less agreeable way";
and so on, governed by the interest and
the effect upon the children. I impressed
on them the real beauty of the
storm, and taught them appreciation,
to take the place of fear.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that that family
no longer dreads the storm cloud.
The suggestion reversed their way of
looking at storms, and they then found
great beauty in them and ceased to fear
them.</p>

<p>Another experience: I once had
the privilege of spending some time in
close relations of friendship to a family
composed of a widowed mother and
several children, sons, daughter, nephews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and nieces. A sister of the mother,
who was pronounced to be an incurable
invalid, had come from her Northern
home to seek relief in the climate of
the Southland. It is impossible to imagine
more tender care of an invalid.
Each member of the family vied with
the others in offering gentle attentions,
so that the waning life was filled with
happiness that made invalidism almost
a pleasure, as being the cause of so
much loving consideration.</p>

<p>One morning the life-light flickered
for a little and then went out. The
usual funeral preparations which are
the custom were attended to, and the
remains were sent away to the far-distant
home, and the family burial-lot.</p>

<p>While the remains were awaiting the
appointed time of removal, the children
of the family, of all ages and both
sexes, passed in and out of the death-chamber,
by day or by night, as if there
had been no death, and there was not
a semblance of dread, nor fearthought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
nor mourning. It was such a beautiful
expression of loving consideration, unmarred
by dread or fearthought, that
one might well choose such a time and
such a place and such environment on
the occasion of one's passing on to the
better life.</p>

<p>If it be possible to be a spirit, conscious
of material environment, and
in such guise to attend one's own
funeral, which would be the environment
of choice? Egotism, disembodied,
would undoubtedly choose a
scene of violent mourning, long drawn
out, and painful to as many as possible.
Loving Unselfishness would as certainly
choose a funeral scene such as I witnessed
in the house of my friends.
Which would you choose? And if, as
is most reasonable to suppose from observing
the sequences of nature's processes
that show that the seed of a
flower has a more nearly perfect flower
enfolded within itself, spirits also become
purer by each unfolding through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the release called death, and being made
pure and unegotistic by the change,
they must prefer, if they have the
privilege, to have their old home remains
viewed with loving and fearless
consideration, rather than with fearsome
dread and ostentatious emotion.</p>

<p>Then let us abjure fear in connection
with death, and also in connection
with the mortal remains of the beloved.</p>

<p>If the conventional premises relative
to death be correct, the common attitude
towards it is useless; and if the
hypothetical premises be correct, as it
is better to suppose, even if we cannot
assert it, the common attitude is worse
than useless, for it is both harmful and
unjust. If we cultivate fear and mourning
in connection with death, we are
unjust to the dead, we are unjust to the
living, we are unjust to ourselves; and,
above all, cruel to the tender and impressionable
emotions of children, to
whom we are constantly leaving legacies
of cowardice and ignorant egotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or legacies of pure suggestion, love and
appreciation.</p>

<p>Much might be written about the
subject of this chapter, and many illustrations
could be given wherein illogical
fears have been, or can be, ridiculed
away, but inasmuch as some of the following
chapters are mainly devoted to
this purpose, it is not necessary to
more than suggest a line of argument
under the present caption.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_NOW-FIELD" id="THE_NOW-FIELD"></a>THE NOW-FIELD.</h2>


<p>Let us work together for a season
in the Now-Field.</p>

<p>We cannot work in any other field,
but we can and do waste much valuable
time in trying to work in the
past or in the future, and in so doing
neglect the precious now.</p>

<p>For recreation we may pleasantly,
and perhaps profitably, speculate as to
what there may be in the way of atoms
finer than star-dust, and as to the possible
degree of invisibleness of the
ultimate ether. We may also exercise
and strengthen our imagination by trying
to give form to the Source of it all.
Tiring of guessing in these directions,
we may vary our recreation by attempts
to peep under or through the veil
which Nature so persistently holds
between the present conscious life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the one we hope for beyond the veil.
It can do no harm to think form into a
forgotten past and into an uncertain
future, if, in so doing, the vital and
superprecious now be well guarded
against the things we know to be deterrent
to the best growth of the life-plant.</p>

<p>In considering the duty of the now,
let us, for convenience of comparison,
liken life to an agricultural season of
one year's duration. We find, in ourselves,
that the seed from which we
have unfolded has already been sown,
and the life-plant pretty well grown
before we attain consciousness of duty
and begin to think independently. If
we are lucky, we have been taught
early what the real object of life is,
our duties in it, and the true values
to be cultivated in connection with it.</p>

<p>We have very sensibly learned to
get in out of the wet when it rains, and
many other useful aids to comfort as
well as to protection, but the most vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
assistants of growth have been neglected,
and many positive deterrents to
growth have been cultivated by those
who have been our teachers, and hence
it behooves us to look to our habits of
thought and of action in order to get
rid of those which are detrimental to
our growth.</p>

<p>Of first importance is the care of
the Now-Field.</p>

<p>We have already suggested, and it
cannot be too often repeated, that the
condition favorable and necessary to
growth is that of harmony&mdash;an harmonious
present is the living heir and
parent of all harmonies&mdash;that growth
is the evident object of life, and that
when anything ceases to grow it begins
to die&mdash;there is no growth except in
the present, and no cultivable field
other than the Now-Field&mdash;that harmony,
through one's ability to always
furnish the concordant note, one's self,
is within the power of each, regardless
of environment or physical conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
if <em>only</em> present conditions and environment
are considered, and that growth
is the certain result of harmony; that
our function relative to growth is only
to keep deterrent influences out of the
present; that, if we do this, Nature never
fails to develop better results from the
unfolding of each succession. We have
learned that all of the deterrents we
have been able to discover and classify
are phases of fearthought; that fearthought
is no creation of the present,
but is sought in the future and nourished
on the life-blood of the present&mdash;an
excrescent and altogether parasitic
abnormality, unnecessary to the
thing it feeds on.</p>

<p>We have discovered, in our search
for deterrents, that, if encountered in
the now, they are easily routed. We
have also discovered that the longest
life is but a succession of nows. If so,
how easy becomes the problem: Work
diligently in the Now-Field.</p>

<p>In arguing against the potency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
anger and worry and other expressions
of fearthought, where the contention
has been persisted in that they were
necessary evils, and amenable only to
suppression, not to elimination, I have
invariably won my point when suddenly
asking the question, "Are you angry
or worried at this moment?" by the
admission of my opponent, "No; not at
this moment, because my mind is occupied
with something which has no element
of worry or anger in it." The replies
vary, of course, but are to the
same effect. I immediately return with
the question: "Is not all time but a succession
of nows, and, if so, cannot all of
the nows, as well as this one, be exempt
from apprehension and irritation,
by continuing to think of pleasanter and
more hopeful and helpful things?"</p>

<p>Each succeeding now is easier of
control than the preceding one from
which it learns the habit-of-control, and,
if the immanent now is guarded, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
nows that follow will take care of themselves.</p>

<p>As we have observed, we need not
think of the growing if we are only
diligent in keeping fearthought out of
our minds. Nature will do abundant
growing for us, and if we do not seek
fearthought beyond the now, we will
have nothing to keep out. <em>It is easier
than not!</em></p>

<p>Does it not seem <em>very</em> easy when
one thinks reasonably about it? If
we confine our efforts to the Now-Field,
we leave our enemy out in the
cold by the comfortable process of
non-invitation. Therefore, let us work
together for a season in the Now-Field.</p>

<h3>FEARTHOUGHT.</h3>

<p>Fear is fear<em>thought</em> only.</p>

<p>Fear is caused by the <em>self-imposed</em> or
<em>self-permitted</em> suggestion of <em>inferiority</em>.</p>

<p>Fear is not a physical thing, but it
causes physical derangement.</p>

<p>Fearthought is <em>self-imposed</em>, and is
therefore unnecessary.</p>

<p>Fearthought, being evil and unnecessary,
is therefore <em>not-respectable</em>.</p>

<p>Fearthought is a habit which is
altogether irrational and illogical.</p>

<p>Fearthought is a parasite which, in
civilized man, is entirely abnormal.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought can be eliminated from
the mind.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fearthought is the tap-root of all
evil and trouble.</p>

<p><em>Anger</em> and <em>worry</em> are expressions of
fearthought.</p>

<p>All forms of worry are directly
caused by fearthought.</p>

<p>Anger is directly or indirectly caused
by fearthought.</p>

<p>All of the evil passions which group
themselves under the class-names of
anger and worry are therefore the result
of fearthought.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the result of egotism.
Egotism is the reverse, or, rather, perverse,
of Egociation. It is caused by self-separation
from Co-operative-Strength,
from Universal-Good&mdash;from God.</p>

<p>Selfishness is the fruit and the evidence
of egotism.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the first expression
of selfishness.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought is</em>, therefore, <em>the tap-root
of evil and consequent unhappiness</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Forethought invites success.</p>

<p>Fearthought invites failure.</p>

<p>The future is the vital part of life&mdash;the
dead past furnishing only food
for reminiscence and experience.</p>

<p>Consideration of the future must
partake of either forethought or fearthought&mdash;it
cannot partake of both at
the same time.</p>

<p>Fearthought is in no way related to
forethought except as the shadow is
related to the tree behind which it hides
from the light&mdash;the light of right-thinking.</p>

<p>Forethought stimulates, aids, fosters,
encourages, and insures success of
honest aims&mdash;its child is growth.</p>

<p>Fearthought relaxes, hampers, strangles,
and thereby retards growth, to the
end of dwarfing, if not killing, it&mdash;its
children are paralysis, disease, unhappiness
and death.</p>

<p>Forethought is a producer.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought is a robber.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Forethought is constructive.</p>

<p>Fearthought is destructive.</p>

<p>Forethought suggests the building
of houses for shelter wherein there can
be no fearthought about storms.</p>

<p>Fearthought fusses and worries over
the possibility of not getting the shelter
ready in time to protect against inclement
weather, and thereby wastes
the available energy, and delays the
completion of the shelter.</p>

<p>Forethought calmly proceeds to perform
a useful task without fearthought
of the extent of it. It does all that it
can do&mdash;it can do no more.</p>

<p>Fearthought wrings its hands, and
wastes its time in saying, "How can I
ever do it?"</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in determining
between forethought and fearthought.</p>

<p>Whatever thought is constructive,
is forethought.</p>

<p><em>Whatever thought is destructive or
wasteful is fearthought.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fearthought is the devil.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the arch-enemy of
man, whose influence can be traced in
every form of calamity and unhappiness.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the cause of indecision,
suspicion, apprehension, jealousy,
envy, indifference, self-degradation
and all other forms of weakness
which separate the afflicted from the
tide of success and happiness, and which
condemn them to the whirling and restless
eddy of isolation and non-progression.</p>

<p>Fearthought is blasphemy, because
it gives the lie to the fixed promises of
God, as evidenced by experience.</p>

<p>Fearthought is like carbonic-acid
gas pumped into one's atmosphere. It
causes mental, moral and spiritual asphyxiation,
and sometimes death&mdash;death
to energy, death to tissue and
death to all growth.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought is a liar, and the father
of lies.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quarantine against Fearthought
first.</p>

<p>Fearthought is more contagious
than any other disease.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the chief distributer
and promoter of other contagious
diseases.</p>

<p>Fearthought can be guarded against
by anti-toxic means, just as smallpox
and diphtheria can be guarded against.</p>

<p>The serum to be used against fearthought
is intelligent, persistent right
suggestion.</p>

<p>Fearthought can also be quarantined
against, the same as other contagious
diseases.</p>

<p>Society can quarantine against fearthought
by refusing to tolerate it as a
necessity of civilized life&mdash;by classing
it as not-respectable, and by refusing
to feed it with sympathy.</p>

<p>Quarantine against fearthought in
the individual is an easy matter to any
one who will learn that it is only evil
and never good.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought should be kept "without
the gates."</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Forethought for others is the most
intelligent altruism.</p>

<p>Forethought is the natural condition,
but can exist only in the absence
of fearthought.</p>

<p>Forethought growing out of disagreeable
or disastrous experience is a
useful and worthy fruit; but fearthought
taken from the same experience
adds to the evil.</p>

<p>If a child be guarded against fearthought,
he will enjoy immunity from it
during life&mdash;a life twice or thrice prolonged
in consequence. Parents should
note the responsibility.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The consensus of the experience of
parents, of physicians, of biologists, and
of everyone who has observed child-life,
is that the premises and deductions
here given are correct, but as yet
there has been no systematic effort
made to eliminate fearthought out of
the atmosphere of children, as there
has been to eliminate weeds, malaria,
contagious diseases, and other evils.
Society should unite for defense against,
and the extermination of, <em>childhood's
worst enemy</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fearthought is the most pregnant
cause of disaster and death.</p>

<p>Whoever teaches fearthought to a
child, by either legend or example,
may be a murderer by so doing.</p>

<p>Whoever permits or nurses fearthought
within himself, sows the seed
of suicide.</p>

<p>Whoever robs a child of the freedom
of mind with which nature prefers
to endow it, whether it be through pre-natal
suggestion or through suggestion
given after birth, is more a thief than
one who robs it of its patrimony of
goods or lands.</p>

<p>Whoever teaches or permits a child
to suffer fearthought may never know
the end of the disturbance caused thereby.
Lying, stealing, avarice, suicide
and murder may lie within the wake
of its influence.</p>

<p>If parents have wronged their children
unwittingly, they may yet correct
the infliction by right example and by
right counter-suggestions, lovingly, patiently,
persistently and religiously
given until the evil has been eradicated.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought is the seed of Suicide.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Freedom is a Birthright.</p>

<p>Civilized Society insures Freedom.</p>

<p>The author has had much experience
within the past few years which
teaches that fearthought itself, and
tendency to fearthought, are bad habits
of the mind, that can be entirely
counteracted if so desired, and if the
desire be accompanied by reasonable
assistance on the part of the afflicted
ones.</p>

<p>Fearthought is the last relic of
animal suspicion to be located, analyzed
and dispelled. When it is
entirely killed; then, and only then,
will man become free&mdash;free to grow,
free to appreciate his divine inheritance
and free to enjoy it as ordained.
As in agriculture and in horticulture,
so in menticulture, and its contingent,
physiculture, will it be found that deterrents
to perfect growth can be eradicated,
and that if attention to the
germ-eradication of the deterrents is
intelligent and persistent, God will
surely develop perfect growth and the
perfect fruit of happiness.</p>

<p><em>Freedom is easier than not.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fearthought is the result of ignorance
or perversity.</p>

<p>Fearthought which is perverse is
criminal.</p>

<p>Fearing for others is criminal, because
it not only depresses and weakens
them, but because it robs them of some
part of the strength that encouragement
and hopeful thought would give
them.</p>

<p>Parents who do not wish to poison
the natural energy of their children by
depression and weakness, should learn
the effect of telepathic influence for
good or for evil, and thereby know that
all of the expressions of fearthought
are rank poisons.</p>

<p>Parents hold the key to character.</p>

<p>Whenever parents allow or teach
their children to have fearthought,
they foster in them the temptation to
lie and steal.</p>

<p><em>Crime lurks in fearthought.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ignorance is <em>not</em> bliss.</p>

<p>Ignorance can no longer be accepted
as an excuse for the toleration of fear.</p>

<p>Thought precedes every emotion and
every act of life. It must have no
element of fear in it, if it is to lead up
and on.</p>

<p><em>Habit-of-thought</em> asserts itself on all
occasions. <em>Habit-of-feeling</em> is the truer
description, for the reason that it is
the emotional self and not the thought-self
that first responds to surprise.</p>

<p>Habit-of-thought or habit-of-feeling
can be trained to respond to surprise
with "I <em>must not be</em> afraid," as easily as
it is permitted to respond with the
cowardly dictum, "I <em>am</em> afraid."</p>

<p>If one have the habit-of-fearthought
in any form or degree, surprise may
cause it to inspire rash action which
may end in disaster. More lives are
lost through jumping <em>into</em> danger under
the impulse of fearthought, than
are ever saved by it. Calm forethought
is the better friend in a case of
peril than quaking fearthought.</p>

<p><em>I must not be afraid!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fearthought is a dissembler.</p>

<p>Fearthought is a very dangerous
enemy, because it habitually masquerades
in the garb of forethought.</p>

<p>Many earnest persons who desire to
cultivate only the best thought, believe
that fearthought is forethought, and
invite and nurse it as such.</p>

<p>The lexicographers even, have
failed to separate fearthought from
forethought, and hence it does not
appear in the dictionaries under its
specific descriptive appellation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let fear be disguised no longer. It
is a child of ignorant or perverse
imagination. It is fear<em>thought</em> only.
It is always irrational and illogical. It
has no element of good nor of protection
in it. Separated from forethought,
fearthought causes only paralysis and
death, and neither energizes nor saves
life. It is the devil. It is the result of
false premises or impressions, but can
be counteracted by logical premises and
right impressions.</p>

<p><em>Fearthought is a masquerader.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The timid are the most impressionable,
and can be cured of fearthought
by intelligent, persistent,
counter-suggestion.</p>

<p>Impressibility is as powerful an aid
to good or right suggestion as it is to
bad or false suggestion. Differently
used, an element of weakness becomes
an element of strength. In a matter of
mind-accomplishment no one need say
"I can't," for mind is what it most
earnestly wishes to be.</p>

<p>Limiting weaknesses there are, at
present, but these are generally found
in asylums. A crusade against fearthought
would, within one generation,
make asylums unnecessary.</p>

<p>Average intelligence can be cleared
of fearthought. A crusade against
fearthought would immeasurably raise
the average of intelligence.</p>

<p>Let no one deprecate himself or his
fellows as to his or their possibilities.
The timid may become courageous;
the weak may become strong; the sick
may become well, and the unhappy may
become happy, by the reversal of the
attitude of their energy toward life's
problems.</p>

<p><em>Courage is a birthright.</em></p>

<p>Fearlessness of death insures the
strongest love of life.</p>

<p>No one can know what it is to appreciate
life at its best until he has
ceased to have any suspicion of dread
of death.</p>

<p>No one can realize the keenest enjoyment
of life until he has grown to
<em>feel</em>&mdash;<em>appreciate</em>&mdash;that this life is an
important stage of an evolutionary
process, in which the dawning of spiritual
possibilities opens up the realm of
divine existence to him, and introduces
to his consciousness that <em>appreciation
of God which gives birth to love, growth
and happiness</em>.</p>

<p>When fearthought is entirely eradicated
from the mind by the elimination
of the basic fear&mdash;the fear of death&mdash;man
begins to <em>feel</em> the responsibility of
growing his best, of ripening in natural
manner, and of dropping into the lap
of Mother Earth only when he has instilled
into himself the richest and
sweetest juices of an appreciative and
altruistic life.</p>

<p>Mother-thought is the strongest of
all thought.</p>

<p>Voluntary motherhood is the bravest
of all acts common in life.</p>

<p>Whoever teaches a child to be fearless,
builds greater than she can ever
know, for fearlessness in one inspires
courage in many; and as courage inspires
strength and causes action, there
is no end to what may grow out of the
fearless influence of the frailest and
physically weakest of women, and any
young mother, in the quiet and seclusion
of a modest home, can set in motion
vibrations of strength and fearlessness
that may result in the building
of a great city or the invention of some
world-emancipating tool of progress.</p>

<p>All great accomplishments can
be traced back to mother-influence.
Mother-muscle may be wanting, but
mother-thought rules the world.</p>

<p>Mother-thought is always brave-thought
in <em>one</em> emergency, and therefore

<p>All water is pure water.</p>

<p>It is impurities within water

<p>All men are innately good.</p>

<p>It is the presence of false impressions,

<p>There is no impurity in water that

<p>In your judgment of men, judge the

<p>The perfection of anything is dependent

<p>Good society is made up of good
individuals; individuals are measured
by their qualities of mind and character;
and mind and character are
pure and good according as their constituent
elements are pure and good.</p>

<p>Fearthought is a weak element of
mind and its influence on character is
blighting.</p>

<p>In chemistry and in mechanics we

<p>Nervousness is frequently discreditable,

<p>Nervousness is the "scapegoat" for
much cowardice, ignorance and perversion,
sometimes of prenatal, but
generally of post-natal, origin. It is not
as respectable as scrofula, for the reason
that scrofula may have been inherited
or contracted by the accident
or evil doing of another, and can be
corrected only by process of regeneration;
while nervousness is an expression
or reflection of fearthought which
can be corrected by one's own right-thinking.</p>

<p>Whoever is not nervous when he
is asleep <em>need not be</em> nervous when he
is awake.</p>

<p>Eminent physicians have recently

<p>Attraction rules the universe.</p>

<p>The rivalry between attraction and
counter-attraction is friendly.</p>

<p>Evolution is the result of being attracted
to increase and to growth, and
not the result of being <em>pushed</em> to growth.</p>

<p>All plant life inclines towards the
light and the sun.</p>

<p>Plant life that is strong enough to
withstand the storms, turns its back in
protest to the wind.</p>

<p>Pessimists snarlingly assert that attraction
is the <em>pushing of desire</em> for
change, but pessimists are diseased
themselves, and therefore call things
by wrong names, and give the wrong
construction to everything.</p>

<p>Appreciation and resultant Love are
caused by attraction, and not by fear.</p>

<p>Whatever is attracted forward or
upward, will remain in advance or
above.</p>

<p>Forethought is eagerly receptive and
seeks progress through attraction.</p>

own cowardice, and accomplishes nothing
useful.</p>

<p>Consideration is practical altruism.</p>

<p>Consideration for others is evidenced
by desiring to do for them what is
most desired by them, or, what is best

<p>Consideration is "catching," and the
easiest way to accomplish one's own
desires, in connection with others, is to
suggest consideration by consideration.</p>

<p>No one ever "lost a trick, or missed
a meal," by being considerate; and simple,
unaffected consideration has often
been the means of adding great possessions
to its own richness.</p>

<p>"After you," will unravel a crowd
quicker than any pushing to be first.</p>

<p>Fearthought, and the selfishness
growing out of it, are the origin of all
lack of consideration for others; and
contact with others, and the every-day
amenities of life furnish constant opportunity
for attacking one of the
strongest expressions of the disease of
fearthought by practice of altruistic
consideration.</p>

<p><em>The first requisite of gentility is
consideration.</em></p>

<p>Happy Day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morrow," "good day," "good
morning," and "good evening," were
originally intended to have the same
significance as our opening salutation,
but now they have generally become
stale and mean no more than
"how are y&mdash;" "how d'y" and other
perfunctory greetings that are ridiculous
when rendered with an inflection
that resembles a grunt.</p>

<p>Elsewhere it is related how "happy
day" is used in some families to greet
the morning.</p>

<p>What humanity is suffering from is
a restriction of affections, and an effusion
of fears.</p>

<p>People are afraid of being frank and
therefore cultivate the sulks, suffer and
become ill from the repression.</p>

<p>If you cannot greet the morning

<p>Forethought is Optimism.</p>

<p>All good men are optimists.</p>

<p>The contrastive definitions of "optimism,"
and "pessimism" and "content,"
as given by Rev. Dr. Newel
Dwight Hillis in an address on optimism,
which the author had the pleasure
of hearing, are in themselves an epitome
of good suggestion relative to
the profitable attitude toward the
past, the present and the future.</p>

<p>Said Dr. Hillis, "The pessimist cries,
'all is ill, and nothing can be well'; the
idle dreamer assumes that 'all is well,'
but the optimist declares that 'all has
not been ill, and all has not been well&mdash;all
is not ill, and all is not well&mdash;but
all <em>can be</em> and therefore <em>shall be</em> well.'"</p>

<p>Appreciation of ever-present blessings&mdash;the
sun, the birds, the perfume
of the flowers, the mist, the constant
changes in the aspect of nature, the
love of friends, the hurdles that are
met and cleared at a bound, and even
the obstructions that Providence places
in the <em>wrong road</em>, make them all seem
to chant in chorus,&mdash;"No matter what
has been; no matter what is; all <em>can
be</em> and <em>shall be</em> well."</p>

<p><em>Optimism is life.</em></p>

<p>Fearthought inspires Pessimism.</p>

<p>Pessimism is a false prophet.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem to be in the
interest of freedom if the utterances of
evil foreboding and pessimistic prophesy
were frowned upon, if pessimists
were avoided as lepers are avoided,
and if their effect on growth and development
were to measure the merit or
demerit of thoughts or teachings, as
well as of actions.</p>

<p>Society's duty toward the individual
is wisely to prevent him from doing
harm, either to himself or to others.
All experience teaches that pessimism
is generally lying prophesy. To prohibit
false prophesy, that can only
injure both the maker and the hearer
of it, would seem, then, to be not only
the right, but the duty, of society.
To prohibit bad suggestion as well as
bad action, when action is known to be
but materialized or realized suggestion,
would seem to be a duty of
society.</p>

VERSUS REPRESSION.</h2>


<p>The attitude of Man towards his
weaknesses is commonly that of repression.
He assumes that fearthought,
and fear, and anger, and worry, and all
of the evil passions are inherent things
that may be repressed but not eradicated;
modified but not eliminated;
kept under partial control but not gotten
rid of; and cut down below the surface,
so as not to be exposed to the
world, but not rooted out entirely.</p>

<p>By some persons it is even thought
to be an accomplishment of great merit
to acknowledge strong roots of carnal
weakness and to then succeed in hiding
any outward expression of them. In
others, equally well-meaning, the aggressive
and consumptive passions are
nursed and exhibited as evidences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
unusual sensitiveness and virility
appertaining to fineness, goodness and
greatness. It is not long since it was the
custom of clergymen in some denominations
to assume unworthiness for themselves
in order to glorify the redeeming
power of the Saviour, notwithstanding
all of Christ's teachings inculcated that
true forgiveness consisted in the simple
process of <em>ceasing to have</em>&mdash;ceasing
to admit, or import. When, in former
times, priesthood was degraded to a
business&mdash;an occupation for a living,
or for convenience or power&mdash;it was
natural that the difficulty of the service
rendered the laity by the priests
should be exaggerated so as to command
the highest respect, the greatest
power and the largest compensation.
Sin was made to seem powerful and
ever-present in order that the service
rendered in keeping it in check might
seem important and everlasting. Under
such circumstances, and especially when
the one great unpardonable sin against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the church was that of doubting the
teachings of these teachers, how almost
impossible must it have been for the
laity to rise superior to evil, when those
whose profession it was to combat it,
found it so potent an enemy, and who,
thereby, filled the atmosphere of thought
with dense clouds of evil suggestion.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for the present generation
that such shadows of suggestion
do not hopelessly oppress it. There
are many churches now where appreciation,
and love, and purity, and the
delights of unselfishness are offered as
the attractions towards religion, and
where the teachers in them stand for
examples of pure thinking, pure living,
and spontaneous altruism, practiced as
a result of natural impulses that are
both agreeable and profitable, and not
to save from hell or to fit for a remote
heaven. But the shadow of the old
method, that so long hid the Christ-method
of true thinking and living,
still has an influence in giving strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to evil to afflict the weaker sons of our
civilization. This shadow, however,
cannot long remain. The light of the
present awakening is too strong&mdash;too
electric and too penetrating&mdash;to permit
it to remain.</p>

<p>It is even looked upon now as a
curiosity&mdash;a relic of antiquity&mdash;to hear
the old fears given expression from the
pulpit, but root eradication of them is
not yet insisted upon as the first and
most important teaching, as it should
be. It is a common thing now, also, to
hear altruistic teaching and optimistic
preaching from the pulpits of all denominations,
and to hear from the
teachers and preachers the assurance
that "it is easier than not and more
profitable in every way to be unselfish
and not to tolerate evil," the new good
suggestion of which, is the inspiring
assertion that, "<em>it is easier than not</em>."</p>

<p>It would be a rare thing now to find
a religious teacher of intelligence who
would not agree with the assertion that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
when a person is angry, he cannot be,
at the moment, a Christian, for being
angry is as unchristian as profanity.
The same condemnation applies to
worry, which is especially commanded
against, and which, in the light of the
observed promises of God as expressed
by the preponderance of the prevalence
of good, is not less than blasphemous
in its exhibition of lack of confidence
in, and appreciation of, the Giver of
All Good.</p>

<p>A most helpful thought in connection
with the easy subjugation of the
<em>animalesque</em> expressions of fearthought
is, that they are not inherent things, and
that they are imported whenever suffered.
The tendency to import is inherent,
and the <em>tendency</em> to entertain evil
is the shadow of past error in the race
which is called race-habit-of-thought,
and it is that which has to be replaced
by right-habit-of-thought before one is
entirely free, but tendency is easily
overcome when its parents are discredited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and made not-respectable
thereby.</p>

<p>The spiritual awakening of the present
era that is reclaiming Christianity
from the supernatural, or unnatural, and
applying it to everyday affairs, may be
called practical or business Christianity.
A business man who has an occupation
wherein it is possible for him to be
altruistic, after reading the theory that
is the contention of <cite>Menticulture</cite>, wrote
a commentary in which he said: "On
these precepts not only 'hang all of the
law and the prophets,' but, also, common
business sense and <em>all of the
profits</em>."</p>

<p>As an illustration of the difference
between eradication (or filtration) and
repression (or gradual dilution or reform)
I will cite a common example:
Suppose a vessel to be filled with
muddy water which we wish to make
clear, so that it will perfectly reflect the
ether above, which we call the sky; the
easy and effective method is first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pass the water through a filter and
thereafter to protect it from contamination.
On the contrary, the difficult,
expensive, endless and, therefore ineffective
method is to pour unlimited
clear water into the vessel, in order to
gradually replace the muddy water with
the excess of pure water.</p>

<p>While it is true that "perfect love
casteth out fear," it also is true that
there can be no perfect love until
there is first perfect freedom from fear,
so that the right way to approach
the problem of creating the harmonious
condition in the human mind
wherein growth ripens in happiness, is
to take the mind when it is returned to
us at the moment of awaking from
sleep, when it has been purified by contact
with Spiritual Cerebration, and
protect it from that time forth through
each day, by refusing <em>to import</em> suspicion,
anger or worry into it, a process
that is <em>easier than not</em>, and pleasanter
and more profitable than any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Each day, the tendency to import,
which is the only part of the process of
eradication that is in any way real, will
become less strong, and, with even the
weakest attempts to discourage it; but
if you are sufficiently in earnest to say,
"Begone, you tempter," and thereby
slam the door in his face, you will
accomplish freedom at once.</p>

<p>The self-infliction of fearthought is a
shoveling-in process&mdash;all that you have
to do to become free from it is to stop
shoveling. It is easier to stop importing
fearthought, and anger, and worry,
and suspicion, than it is to import them;
therefore,</p>

<p><em>Stop importing!</em></p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_IMPOTENCE_OF_PAIN" id="THE_IMPOTENCE_OF_PAIN"></a>THE IMPOTENCE OF PAIN.</h2>


<p>During the Japanese-Chinese war,
two Japanese students were arrested
in Shanghai on the charge of espionage,
and were taken to Ningpo and tortured
to death.</p>

<p>The method of torture was the most
cruel known, and included a slow crushing
of the most sensitive parts of their
anatomy.</p>

<p>The young patriots displayed such
heroism under the torture that the incident
gave rise to considerable discussion
as to the relative sensitiveness of
the Mongolian and the Caucasian races
to pain. The consensus of the opinion
that I saw expressed, which was, by
the way, Caucasian opinion only, was
that the Oriental was less sensitive,
and therefore was not entitled to as
much credit for withstanding pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as the self-adjudged, more-sensitive
Westerner.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, that there
is a limit to actual pain within the
power of any one to endure, if the element
of fearthought-of-more-pain is
eliminated, so that the absorbing heroism
of the patriot&mdash;almost courting
torture for the honor of his cause&mdash;puts
the element of fearthought out
of the case, and leaves only the actual
sensation to be suffered. Pain is undoubtedly
intended as a warning of
disordered conditions, and not as a
punishment, and, having performed its
mission, is relieved by a kind paralysis
before the shock is too severe for human
endurance.</p>

<p>This is the beneficent provision of
the natural law, but when it comes to
the exercise of unnatural fearthought,
there is no limit to the torture a victim
may impose upon himself, and, on a
basis of a very little real pain, build up
most terrible suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The author has tested the truth of
this assertion personally.</p>

<p>Being condemned to submit to a
dental operation of unusual severity,
the opportunity to experiment was
gladly availed of, even at the expense
of comfort.</p>

<p>One special aggravation of the operation
was the prying open of the mouth,
in order to build up from the root one
of the teeth located farthest back in
the mouth. The mouth was not large
enough to suit the facile convenience
of the dentist, and hence he made use
of all the skill and power he possessed
to enlarge the cavity, and having
stretched it to the utmost, firm wedges
held it open, without possibility of protest,
for three hours on a stretch; and
on these instruments and conditions of
torture I had ample opportunity to experiment;
so sufficient&mdash;for all practical
purposes&mdash;that I do not feel it
necessary to repeat the experiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
even in the interest of scientific investigation.</p>

<p>The experiment proved, however,
my contention, that even the greatest
possible pain is of itself not very severe,
and that it requires but a slight
diversion to make one forget it, for
the time being, entirely. I was able,
at any moment of the combined irritation,
to concentrate my mind upon
some subject or object, and to lose the
sense of pain out of my consciousness
altogether&mdash;and at will.</p>

<p>Major General O. O. Howard,
U. S. A. (retired) has recently corroborated,
to the author, out of his own
experience, the possibility of forgetting
pain through slight diversion. He lost
an arm during the Civil War, and in the
process of recovery some of the nerve-ends
were not properly cicatrized, so
that ever since the wound healed the
General has not been free from the sensation
of pain, whenever his mind has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
reverted to it, and yet he is able at any
time to forget it by change of thought.</p>

<p>In like manner, fear-of-trouble is the
major part of all the so-called trouble
that is experienced. As intimated in
the "definitions," under the caption of
"Trouble," there are few real conditions
that are very uncomfortable, if
apprehension of still more uncomfortable
conditions is not imported to exaggerate
the existing discomfort. Fear
of freezing to death or of drowning
may be made very terrible, for instance,
whereas the end in freezing and in
drowning is known to be so comfortable,
and even blissful, that those who
are on the point of passing out of life
by those means dislike to be called back
to life again.</p>

<p>The heroism of mothers in the event
of child-birth is too well known to call
for reference, but there is the greatest
difference in the ease or in the discomfort
of the condition attending the process,
which is largely influenced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
feeling of welcome or the attitude of
aversion with which the new-comer is
greeted by the mother.</p>

<p>The point-of-view has much to do
with the sting of pain. Whoever has
suffered that severest of all spankings,
the water spanking incident to a clumsy
dive, or a wrongly-calculated somersault
into the water from a wharf, or
from a natatorium springboard, will remember
that the pain of it is not half
so hard to bear as the form of parental
correction called by the same name,
that in itself is not nearly so severe.</p>

<p>Sensitiveness to pain is largely due
to the fear of pain, and a reversal of the
accustomed attitude towards fear will
have an immediate effect upon the
severity of pain by mitigating much of
its sting. Christian scientists, mental
scientists, spiritual scientists, faith curists,
and all others who practice mental
therapeutics in physical diseases,
escape much suffering in this way,
and the happy result of this attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
towards pain serves to strengthen their
faith.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause of the relief, it
is good, for it teaches, in a most practical
way, the potency of thought in
overcoming, or, dismissing, real pain as
well as all imaginary evil, and also the
possibility of eliminating fearthought
from the mental equipment, by showing
how impotent to harm are the
realities that inspire it, when it is prevented
from exaggerating them.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="UNHAPPY_UNLESS_MISERABLE" id="UNHAPPY_UNLESS_MISERABLE"></a>UNHAPPY UNLESS MISERABLE.</h2>


<p>There are some persons, in fact, a
great many persons, who are not happy
unless they have real or fancied cause
for complaint. Martyrdom is the
recreation of such people and they are
liable to be more greedy for recreation
than those whose recreation is of a
joyous sort.</p>

<p>It is certainly a misplaced kindness
to impose unwelcome attentions on any
one. In the category of nuisances
unwelcome attentions are perhaps the
most disagreeable, and to cram joy
down the maw of one who has no taste
for it, is as rude, and even vulgar, as insisting
that he shall eat something that
is nauseating to him.</p>

<p>It is true that persons who gloat over
misery; who love to mope about in
grave-yards; and are forever telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
grewsome tales for the supposed delectation
of their victims, are not as
agreeable to others as they seem to
be to themselves, and their presence at
festivals and other ostensibly joyous occasions
may be looked on as discordant,
and, as such, out of place.</p>

<p>In these times of license, which are
sometime mistaken for times of unusual
liberty, it is not for anyone to define
what is altogether bad, nor to confine
good, nor good taste, within too narrow
limits; neither is it generous to
prescribe anything that shall be universally
eaten or worn; and, above all
liberties, the liberty to wear a smile or
a frown should prevail; but it is within
the province of organized society to
put its stamp of approval or disapproval
on the time and place for appropriate
use of them. Certain costumes
are suitable in certain places and
not suitable in others. For example,
the bathing suit and the night-robe
have uses that are appropriate for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
special purposes, but they would not be
tolerated on the street by the police,
and it would be no greater curtailment
of liberty to order that frowns shall be
worn only in dark places and not be
permitted to cloud the sunlight, than
that undue levity should be tabooed on
occasions considered to be serious. If
such prescription were to be imposed,
it would be necessary, of course, to
furnish dark places at appropriate, or,
rather, convenient intervals, for the use
of the miserably inclined, in the same
way that spittoons are provided for the
use of those who must expectorate
sputum.</p>

<p>Liberty is so precious a thing that
it must be protected as the holiest of
our possessions, and even if it lap over
into the debatable ground sometimes
called license, it should yet be protected,
and therefore the permission to
wear frowns in appropriate places and
to enjoy being miserable in the privacy
of one's own chamber should be respected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
on the street, or anywhere in
public, however, they should not be
tolerated, for they are harmful generally,
and particularly injurious to
children.</p>

<p>As individuals, those of us who accept
God's promises as truths, who prefer
to live in the sunlight rather than
in a cave, who glorify Appreciation
as the first and best suggestion in the
language, who believe that growth is
the object of life, that its fallow field is
harmony, and that its fruit is happiness,
and also those of us who, by comparison
of conditions have learned to believe
that our pessimistic friends can be
happier than they are, and can become
better companions and citizens by a
change of attitude towards life, although
we may not pass laws of restriction
against the frown-habit or
against the misery-habit, can use
the gentle method of counter-suggestion
to good effect, and even go so far
as to laugh at and otherwise ridicule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the misery-habit, if by thus doing we
may possibly correct that which logic
has failed to cure.</p>

<p>From long observation it has become
evident that the misery-habit
feeds on sympathy. Children, who are
the best examples of honest expression
that we have, whereby to see ourselves
in an unartificial light, will not continue
a mad or a surly crying spell if they
are sure it is not producing a sympathetic
effect. If they think they are
not heard they will at once cease crying.
In the same way, grown persons
who practice the misery-habit in public
take a rest when they are unobserved.
They try to hide it, but they are frequently
caught in the act of unbuttoning
their pouts, and thereby allowing
their faces a rest, as soon as they have
thought themselves out of sight. We
must believe, if this observation be
correct, that the object of pessimism,
or, the misery-habit, is generally to secure,
by dishonest means, selfish attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that are not earned, and for
which no value is given. There are
cases no doubt where the misery-habit
has been acquired by contact with respected
ones who have been the cause
of perverse suggestions too strong to
be resisted, and for such there can only
be pity, and in the cure of whom gentle
and loving suggestion should be
used, but to the perverse and the
chronic practicers of the misery-habit,
no toleration is good, for it is on that,
and unmerited sympathy, that they live
and thrive. On such, all of the misery
possible to be scraped up from the
discords of life should be dumped, and
they should be condemned to herd together,
and if it were possible, they
should be isolated, as lepers are isolated,
from healthy society.</p>

<p>Sometimes the victim of the misery-habit
practices the habit only within
the family. This is especially severe
on the family, and is much more difficult
to treat. The family is at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the seat of the greatest liberty, and the
home and breeding-ground of the
greatest tyranny. The family is supposed
to be under the holy protection
of the divine principle of love, but if
that principle is not a possession of the
family, there is no protection whatever
from most inhuman practices, but instead
a license to the cultivation of most
discordant passions. It is in the family
that mollygrubs are grown and tolerated.
It is in the family that one cannot
get rid of them by running away,
for the family, like the poor, you have
with you always. And who would have
it otherwise? The whole tendency of
civilization is to appreciate the family
more and more, and to cultivate respect
for the family model as the basis of
good government. But it is the very
security of the natural, and therefore
indissoluble, bonds that gives the selfishly
inclined opportunity to practice
the misery-habit without fear of being
thrown out, left behind, cremated or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
otherwise gotten rid of, as dead and
disagreeable matter is usually treated,
in civilized communities.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the misery-habit,
or martyr-habit, are easy to detect, for
while they may be cultivated and laboriously
practiced in private, they are
intended to be seen, and are displayed
at times when they are calculated to be
most conspicuous. The victim of the
martyr-habit is usually an industrious
person. He, or possibly she, will perform
any amount of necessary, and
even unnecessary, manual labor, in
order to exhibit martyr-like fatigue; is
always hanging behind in order to be
slighted; condemns attentions honestly
intended as perfunctory politeness; interprets
praise as being patronage; finds
any part of a chicken served him at
the family table the worst piece, and at
the same time assures the carver that
he has been unduly partial or over-generous&mdash;but,
with a tone of voice or
an expression of countenance that belies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the utterance. A common phrase
of the afflicted martyrite is, "Don't
mind me," and hysterics is the favorite
amusement, while pain and trouble are
the chief stock in trade. And is there
a remedy? Yes.</p>

<p>If Christianity were to be measured
by the optimism of the Master, if the
gauge of optimism prescribed by the
Master were to be used to measure
professing Christians for the name; if
cause and effect were to be placed in
their true relation to each other, and
the ills we cultivate were to be classed
as self-imposed causes and not effects;
and if the unnecessary and unprofitable
were to be ranked as not-respectable;
the misery-habit or martyr-habit would
cease to be fashionable, mollygrubs
would disappear, and the principal
breeding-ground of pessimism&mdash;the
family&mdash;would be purified, as becoming
to its holy office.</p>

WOMAN.</h2>


<p>If a queer sort of human being,
dressed in a costume we had never
seen before, and hailing from some
island we had never heard of, were to
land on our shores and ask our protection
and the privilege of teaching the
religion of his people; if he were to
learn our language sufficiently to convey
his ideas to us; if he were to have
printed the formulas of his religion, and,
among them, his deity's commandments
to men; if the first of these commandments
were to read, "Thou shalt not
strike a woman," what would we
say to such a commandment? and what
would we think of a people who found
it necessary to have such a formula?</p>

<p>Our question would naturally be,
"Do the people of your country <em>ever</em>
strike women?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In our particular state of chivalric
civilization, striking women is one of
the things so entirely out of the question
that we do not consider it even a
possibility, except in cases of insanity
or of drunkenness, where the brute of
the moment is not responsible for his
action.</p>

<p>The very fact of its being an impossible,
and therefore unmentionable,
crime is the strongest suggestion against
it.</p>

<p>If "Thou shalt not strike a
woman" were listed in the category
of commandments, and were constantly
repeated as something hard to resist,
and hence commanded against, I believe
the crime would become common
in circles where it is not thought of as
possible now.</p>

<p>The best thing to do with a condemned
thing is to cover it up, seal it
up, and relegate it to the custody of
the awful, unwritten law of unanimous
disapproval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that when the Jesuit
fathers went to Japan at the end of
the sixteenth century they were warmly
welcomed, and not only were permitted
but invited to teach their religion.</p>

<p>One of the first things they did was
to have the ten commandments of the
old Mosaic law printed in Japanese, in
the form of what we call a tract, and
distributed among the people.</p>

<p>Reading was then, as now, a common
accomplishment with the Japanese,
and they were interested in the
tract. They did not quite understand
its purport, however, and one of their
number was delegated to ask for an
explanation.</p>

<p>Japan is the land, above all others,
where poetry and flowers and idealism
and art and other refinements are
cherished and appreciated. Poetry, in
Japan, is sometimes so idealistic that it
is somewhat vague to any but the poet.
It is the custom, therefore, to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that anything not quite comprehensible
must be poetry; and not understanding
the tract of the fathers, the
Japanese naturally thought it to be a
specimen of Portuguese poetry.</p>

<p>Approaching one of the fathers, the
spokesman of the people bowed with
accustomed politeness and said: "I
trust you will pardon the wretched
ignorance and dullness of my humble
self, but the great interest of my companions,
as well of myself, in your
poem, impels us to ask you to interpret
to us the great depth of its beauteous
crystalline sweetness, in order that we
may enjoy it as it is worthy of being
enjoyed."</p>

<p>The father was shocked to hear
his sacred commandments classed as
worldly poetry, and, drawing himself up
to the full impressiveness of holy indignation,
replied, "That is not poetry;
that is what our God commands that
we <em>must not</em> do."</p>

<p>"Sayo de go zarimasu, gomen na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sai," answered the spokesman in the
polite idiom of his country; "but&mdash;<em>do
the people of your country ever do these
things?</em>"</p>

<p>Whether the Japanese are, or were
three hundred years ago, as exempt
from evil as the enquiry about the ten
commandments would imply, matters
not. The rebuke was well merited and
taught a great, good lesson. We are
the sum of our impressions, and the
suggestions we receive from experience
are the source of our impressions.
Some suggestions are so respected that
they make deep impressions, notably
the suggestions given us by our parents
at our most impressionable age; but all
suggestions have some weight, and to
such purpose that a thing we know to
be untrue becomes a reality to us by
constant repetition, as attested by the
common expression, "He has told that
story so many times that he has come
to believe it himself."</p>

<p>There is scarcely any difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
opinion about the justice of the ten
commandments; but the constant repetition
of "<em>you must not</em>" is like shaking
a red rag before a wild bull, to many
self-assertive children; whereas, if the
things to be commanded against were
understood to be <em>impossible</em>, and therefore
<em>unmentionable</em>, the commandments
would come to fit crimes that had become
as much out of date to us now as
is the crime of striking women.</p>

<p>We have constant evidence of the
fact that beliefs, or, rather, habits-of-belief,
follow persistent assertion, and
that character is largely molded by existing
formulas as well as other influences
of our environment.</p>

<p>Without desire to criticise the formulas
of any creeds, except in the way
of counter-suggestion, I would ask,
"What would be the probable effect of
teaching the constant repetition of the
eleventh commandment in place of
the older ten?&mdash;'A new commandment
I give unto you, that you love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
one another.'" It is impossible to
love and to hate at the same time.
It is impossible to obey the eleventh
commandment and disobey any of the
ten at the same time. Is it not better
practice of suggestion, in order to form
habit-of-thought, to repeat the eleventh
commandment eleven times, than to repeat
each of the ten once and the
eleventh only once?</p>

<p>It is true that the easy way to attain
good is to <em>cease to have evil</em>, but, it is a
poor way to cease to have evil to nurse
it in the memory as a thing <em>difficult not
to have</em>.</p>

<p>If there is to be repetition of anything,
it is better that it should be of
such suggestions as "Appreciation"
and "Love."</p>

<p>The mind is as amenable to the
force of habit as are any of the physical
members of the body. The soul is
much more amenable to suggestion
than either, for it is much more impressionable.
If you were teaching a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
child to play the piano, would you have
him run all the scales, or, rather, combinations
of notes that do not form
scales, that are to be avoided in music,
in order to teach him the habit of <em>not</em>
playing them? Would it be good teaching
to have him habituate his fingers to
the sequence of false scales as well as to
the sequence of true scales? May not
the constant repetition of the commandments
that refer to lewd practices
suggest thoughts about lewdness
that never would come to young minds
by other means, and therefore taint
pure thought, in brutal fashion, by vile
suggestion?</p>

<p>Suppose two men of equal physical
strength were to start in a thousand-mile
bicycle race. Suppose one of the
men were to greet the passing of each
mile-post in this wise: "Only nine
hundred and ninety-nine miles more;
only nine hundred and ninety miles
more," or whatever the distance covered
might be at the time. Suppose
the other were to greet the same mile-posts
otherwise, as "only one mile;"
or, "hang it, only ten miles." Which
racer would win?</p>

<p>In effect, one of the men would be
going down hill and the other would
be going up hill, and just that difference
of approach would win the race
for the person who was rolling down
from one thousand miles to one mile,
from the person who was struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
along the upward course from one
mile to a thousand miles.</p>

<p>Suppose two men were to each feel
a pain in the joint of his big toe. Suppose
one of the attacked ones were to
greet the pain as follows: "Well! I
suppose that means the gout, and I am
to be afflicted for the balance of my
life with that horrible disease. What
have I done to deserve such a fate?
I suppose some of my ancestors are responsible
for this, but I will have to
suffer for it all the same." Suppose
the other victim were to greet the same
symptom in himself differently, as follows:
"Hello, old fellow, what does all
this mean?&mdash;too much rich food, too
much rich wine, too much of everything
that is good to the taste and bad
for the stomach. Well, I might have
expected it. Am ever so much obliged
to you, Mr. Pain, for having warned
me so promptly; I'll take the hint and
correct the error before the trouble gets
seated. Keep me well posted, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Pain. If the disorder does not disappear,
please keep on prodding me so
that I will know if I am doing the right
thing or the wrong thing towards it."
Which of these men would recover
more quickly, and which of them would
suffer more discomfort?</p>

<p>There are always different points-of-view
and different attitudes towards
every problem of life. The different
points-of-view are always in competition,
and, other conditions being equal,
winning or losing is a question of attitude.
The attitude that is directed
by appreciation, gratitude, hope, trust,
or any of the attributes of Forethought,
will always win, as against the attitude
that is handicapped by any shade of
Fearthought.</p>

<p>Life may be filled with disappointments
or with successes merely by the
choice of point-of-view, the pessimistic
point-of-view leading from disappointment
to disappointment, and the optimistic
point of view leading to a succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of successes. As a man thinks,
so does he act, and so does the world
help him to act.</p>

<p>Evolution never places obstacles in
the <em>right</em> road. A seeming obstacle
may be but a hurdle, the clearing of
which may win a prize in the life race.
Some one has said that the supreme
obstacle in life is surmounted by aid of
the progressively difficult smaller obstacles
that are overcome with increasing
ease, and which, if their beneficent
uses are known, become only hurdles
instead of obstructions.</p>

<p>"Set 'em up again; they are all
down but nine," said, in the spirit of
hopeful determination, has won games
for many contestants.</p>

<p>It is the point-of-view that determines
whether an obstacle is a hurdle
or an obstruction, or whether the obstruction,
if it be such, is in the <em>wrong</em>
road or not. If a traveler on life's
road starts with an optimistic point-of-view
he will enjoy obstacles as hurdles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or he will greet obstructions with
pleasure, as being Providentially placed
in the <em>wrong</em> road. In any case he
will be happy about it, and his happiness
will be the best possible stimulant
in aiding him to clear hurdles or to
seek new paths to pleasant places.</p>

<p>The optimistic and pessimistic points-of-view
are the means by which the
concordant and discordant notes in life
are sounded. The merit or demerit of
things lies less within the things themselves,
as far as the observer is concerned,
than in his ability to accept
them complacently, if inevitable, and
to mould or to shape them to profitable
and agreeable uses, rather than to suffer
them as unprofitable and disagreeable.
For example, it is profitable to
look upon all persons and upon all experiences
as teachers, but to reserve
the superiority of choosing to be guided
by them or warned by them according
as the quality of the teaching is good
or bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>There are proverbs in all languages
that teach the preference of the optimistic
point-of-view, but they will avail
little as long as fearthought is tolerated
as a necessary and respectable thing.
Experience endorses the proverbs and
discredits the necessity and respectability
of fearthought.</p>

<p>The Japanese have a proverb, born
of the optimistic point-of-view, that is
very useful to them, inasmuch as the
light wood-construction of their houses
invites frequent fires and sweeping
losses in consequence. After a fire it
is fashionable in Japan for sufferers to
greet each other in sympathy with
the truism, always accompanied by a
smile, "Not much trouble to move,"
and then they all pitch in to assist as
much as possible to rehabilitate each
other through kind attentions that
really make the fires but hot-bed nurseries
of altruistic sympathy, in which
there is more joy than in the greatest
accumulation of possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>After the war&mdash;the recent sectional
dispute, whose theater of destruction was
in the Southern States of America&mdash;many
of the families of the ante-bellum
slave aristocracy were mainly reduced
in possessions, and deprived of some of
the means of ostentation, and in rare
instances, of the necessary means of
comfort; but they had been defeated
in their Cause, and many of them settled
into a state of depression that was
more cruel to them than all the reverses
of the war. Nature continued to be as
kind, the seasons smiled on the crops
with unvarying regularity, and the physical
scars of war were soon healed and
overgrown, but the disappointed ones
heeded not the return of material prosperity.
They focused their point-of-view
upon the past, and refused to see
the smiles and the warmth of the present
and the promise of the future.</p>

<p>Property aristocracy always creates
a false pride, in which the point-of-view
is distorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It will undoubtedly be the same with
the name-proud Greeks as it was with
the property-proud Southrons, and bespeaks
little for the respectability of a
pride that afflicts its victims more seriously
than the destruction of property.</p>

<p>It is a meritorious pride that rises
superior to defeat, and after saying
"Thy Will Be Done" adds, "Teach
Thou Me Appreciation," and begins
the pursuit of peace anew with the
point of view directed by optimism and
not by pessimism.</p>

<p>I have seen whole families, suffering
from self-imposed humiliation and depression,
leap into new life, new growth,
and new happiness at a change of the
point-of-view. The Southerners are,
above all other Americans, chivalrous
and loyally American in their natures.
They are also generally religious, and
cling to the teachings of their parents.
In focusing their point-of-view upon
the past, and, nursing the sting of defeat,
they have thought that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
conserving filial regard, chivalry and
religion, and they have held to the distorted
point-of-view with loyal purpose.
A change of the point-of-view,
rising superior to disappointment, more
nearly satisfied filial pride, while Christian
optimism and gratitude more nearly
became the profession of religion than
the fault-finding dictated by the antiquated
point-of-view. Finding fault
with the happenings of the past is as
much blasphemy as any other disapproval
of the Almighty, and yet blasphemy
is regarded as the wickedest
of sins in religious estimation; and, at
the same time, loading up with a burden
of depression and self-humiliation
is the most unprofitable form of self-abuse
known to economics.</p>

<p>It is better to have an intelligent
and optimistic command of the point-of-view
and hold title to nothing, than to
have possessions valued at millions,
and not count this as the richest possession
of them all. If anything seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to be wrong with you, first examine
the point-of-view. If you do this conscientiously,
you will probably find the
fault therein and seek a remedy by
<em>changing the point-of-view</em>.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="DONT_BE_A_SEWER" id="DONT_BE_A_SEWER"></a>DON'T BE A SEWER.</h2>


<p>A sewer is a channel for the conveyance
of disagreeable matter.</p>

<p>Any person who receives and carries
mean report or suspicion of his neighbor
is therefore a human sewer.</p>

<p>A good sewer is a good thing. It
receives disagreeable matter and carries
it along, hidden from sight and away
from the other senses, to some remote
place, and discharges it there.</p>

<p>A leaky sewer is an abomination.</p>

<p>Human sewers usually leak. They
take delight in letting out the disagreeable
matter they are carrying, at every
street corner, in every parlor, and in
the midst of the multitude, wherever
they may chance to be. The characteristic
of the human sewer is that it
is a leaky sewer. By its leaks it is
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Human sewers themselves generally
create much of their sewage.</p>

<p>I once had a friend, an otherwise
good fellow, who had acquired the
habit of collecting and distributing
social sewage. He was not amenable
to logical suggestion against the habit.
He held the idea that a spade should
be called a spade, and that if disagreeable
things existed, honesty required
that they should be discussed. One
day, when my friend was carrying an
unusually heavy load of sewage, and
was distributing it freely, this thought
came into my mind, and I gave it utterance.
"You remind me of a sewer,"
said I.</p>

<p>There might have been a serious
impairment of our friendship as the result
of my utterance, for my friend is
full of so-called "spirit," had I not
immediately followed my offensive
remark by an apology, and a brotherly
explanation somewhat in the vein as
above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The good effect of the comparison
on my friend is my excuse for introducing
it here. What logic and
persuasion had not been able to accomplish,
offensive comparison accomplished.</p>

<p>My friend is too self-respecting to
allow himself to be in any way related
to a leaky sewer, and has reformed
beautifully. A short time since, in
speaking of the incident, he acknowledged
its effectiveness by saying,
"Every time I think of anything mean
I fancy I can smell it."</p>

<p>It is an excellent rule to follow to
call Suspicion a liar five times before
basing judgment upon its testimony.</p>

<p>If you will take the trouble to investigate
the average accuracy of your
suspicions, you will note that they are
wrong in so many cases that they are
not a safe guide, and are generally unjust
accusers.</p>

<p>While the person who harbors the
suspicion is the worst sufferer in the
end, when the accusations have been
proved to be groundless, there is always
a possibility of injustice, that,
falling on servants or others holding
inferior positions, is exceedingly cruel.</p>

<p>How often, in the household or in
the hotel apartment, is a carelessly
mislaid ring the cause of great unhappiness
to both mistress and maid, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the ready mischief of Fearthought
and its attendant imp, Suspicion.</p>

<p>It is an axiom of the detective service,
that untrained suspicion generally
takes the wrong scent, and that it usually
saves time to look in some other
direction for the culprit, than in that
pointed out by the accuser.</p>

<p>The elimination of the seeds of
Fearthought from the mind, the possibility
of which is the contention of my
theory, will carry with it suspicion, and
relieve one of endless chance of doing
and suffering injustice, but if emancipation
should, unfortunately, not have
been accomplished, it is an excellent
rule to follow, to meet Suspicion with
suspicion, and call it "liar"! five times,
before making accusation on its testimony.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="I_CANT_NOT_DO_IT" id="I_CANT_NOT_DO_IT"></a>I CAN'T <em>NOT</em> DO IT.</h2>


<p>A person more frequently lies when
he says "I can't" than when he says "I
can." There are, to be sure, more
things that one cannot do than there
are that he can do, because the ability
of the strongest and most skillful is
comparatively limited; but the person
who is in the habit of saying "I can't"
usually says it about the wrong thing
or at the wrong time.</p>

<p>Whenever a person says that he
cannot do a thing that God has made
it possible for him to do, and which he
knows to be possible, he is not only a
liar, but also a blasphemer.</p>

<p>If one is asked to climb a tree or
lift a very heavy weight, there may be
reason for saying "I can't," because
of lack of ability, strength or practice.
For the same reason, difficult "runs"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
on a piano, perilous feats of balancing
or turning in gymnastics, and even a
great many simple things that are easy
to the accustomed, may be impossible
to the unaccustomed without certain
practice, and with reference to them it
is reasonable to say, "I can't."</p>

<p>If, however, one is asked <em>not</em> to
climb a tree, or <em>not</em> to lift a weight, or
<em>not</em> to perform a "run" on a piano,
there is no excuse for saying, "I cannot
<em>not</em> do it," for it is as illogical as it is
ungrammatical, and as false as any
other lie.</p>

<p>Applied to mental accomplishment,
it is even more illogical and false, because
thought is more pliable than
muscle.</p>

<p>Not being evil is simply <em>not being
evil</em>, and whoever says, "I cannot <em>not</em>
be bad," is a liar. When he is asleep
he proves the lie.</p>

<p>There are habits-of-desire which
seem attractive to perverted taste, that
may need a strong counter-suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to correct, but there is no habit-of-desire
but what can easily be corrected
by the right counter-suggestion. For
instance, drinking whisky habitually
is recognized to be a bad habit of perverted
desire, but one habitual drunkard
I know of abjured whisky for life
on account of having discovered a dead
fly in his glass.</p>

<p>Sometimes it requires a mania to
cure a mania. Dr. H. Holbrook Curtis,
the eminent throat-specialist of New
York, who has in his care, during grand
opera season, millions of dollars' worth
of voices, and who makes special study
of the mental condition of his patients,
once said to me, "The only cure that I
know of for dipsomania is religio-mania."
This same assertion is frequently
made in quite a different way,
but to the same effect. Dr. Curtis did
not mean by religio-mania religious
<em>appreciation</em>; neither did he mean by
dipsomania, temperate use of stimulants.
He referred to the intemperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
emotion and the morbid taste. The
practice of drinking unduly because of
the social temptation of it may be cured
by logical suggestion, but a mania may
be amenable only to a mania. There
is, however, no bad habit but that can
be corrected by <em>some</em> means, and as
there is some remedy for every separate
phase of evil, it should be considered
not respectable to say, "I cannot
<em>not</em> do"; and, as measure of respectability
is the highest social desideratum
in the present age, the best weapon
to be used against the toleration of
evil in one's self or in others is a general
protest against it on the score of its being
unnecessary and not-respectable.</p>

<p>In my experiments I have used all
sorts of means of suggestion with which
to reach perverse habits of evil thought.
As stated elsewhere, offensive comparisons
and ridicule are more frequently
effective than reason or logic,
and, as such, are often necessary, in the
same way that offensive medicines are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sometimes effective in removing indigestible
matter from the stomach,&mdash;for
example, ipecac.</p>

<p>I had a friend who was in the habit
of saying "I can't" to almost everything.
The habit-of-opposition was so
strong that it was the first to assert itself
on every occasion. The attitude of
opposition was strengthened by the
perverse idea that brutal frankness is
an expression of honesty, and hence
reference to his honesty or dishonesty
was a tender point of etiquette with
my friend. To touch this tender spot,
and administer the strong suggestion&mdash;medicine&mdash;necessary
in the case, I
hit upon this expedient:</p>

<p>Whenever my friend said "I can't"
to a proposition which it did not fit, I
immediately ejaculated "Liar!" At
first there was some danger attending
my experiment, but I took the precaution
to be out of reach, and the fact

<p>At first my offensive criticism was
frequently necessary, but it became less
and less so, till at last the cure is so
complete that the once favorite expression,
"I can't," is as disagreeable
to my friend, as must have been the
dead fly in the glass of the drunkard
previously mentioned, that was the
means of curing him of a deeply rooted
habit.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="A_MILLION_TO_ONE_ON_THE_UNEXPECTED" id="A_MILLION_TO_ONE_ON_THE_UNEXPECTED"></a>A MILLION TO ONE ON THE UNEXPECTED.</h2>


<p>One evening, at a meeting of the
"Ganglionics," in the city of New
Orleans, I asked the president of the
club, Dr. William Benjamin Smith,
the question, "Why is it that the unexpected
generally happens?" His reply,
which induced the caption to this chapter,
was, "Because the expected is only
one thing, while the unexpected may be
a million things."</p>

<p>This is really, as well as figuratively,
true, and, being true, what idiots are
we to waste our time and paralyze
our energies, by thinking fearthought
into the future, on a million-to-one
chance of its hitting the mark.</p>

<p>There is one bull's-eye that we are
sure to hit if we aim at it constantly and
long enough. Death is the one universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
bull's-eye that figures in every
life. At the same time that we are
sure of hitting it, we know by the experience
of others that we do not realize
death when it actually comes, for Nature
kindly administers an anæsthetic
just before death, and sometimes long
before. Then why should we fear
even death?</p>

<p>Persons who have been at the open
door of the unexplored state called
death say that a delightful feeling of
rest comes over the emigrant, and that
entry into the next state is like being
in a beautiful dream.</p>

<p>If this be so, there is also nothing
disagreeable in death&mdash;only in the
fearthought about it&mdash;and hence the
one only bull's-eye we have been sure of
hitting&mdash;the cause of fear of death&mdash;does
not exist, except in our hopes or
our fears.</p>

<p>Many persons who are in the habit
of apprehending cause for fearthought
about the future, and who spend much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of their time in worry, would not like
to be put down in the category of false
prophets, and yet their apprehension
must be false in the ratio of chances of
a million to one.</p>

<p>Thought about chance, as related to
forethought, and from the point-of-view
of the speculator or gambler, suggests
the absurdity of wasting any good
coin&mdash;calm and happiness&mdash;by "laying
it on"&mdash;betting on&mdash;fear. The chances
against having "coppered" the right
fear are not only <em>not even</em>, but are ten
to one against&mdash;an hundred to one
against&mdash;or more&mdash;never less. Even
if you should win by correctly guessing
a fear, you would get back again none
of the happiness that you had sacrificed&mdash;would
not even get your "stake"
back.</p>

<p>As a matter of actual experience, the
following incident is a good example:
A young man employed in a publishing
house, where the proprietor was afflicted
with the fuss-and-fret-habit, contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the disease, and unconsciously
became a victim to its toils. Robust
good health began to give way to languor
that induced dyspepsia and other
contingent disorders, until suicide stared
the young man in the face and haunted
his dreams.</p>

<p>One day some one whispered a suspicion
in the young employee's ear
that was directed at worry and anger
as the causes of his ill-health and unhappiness
and the thought led his systematic
habits-of-business to suggest
"keeping tab" on at least one of the
suspects, to see if it were the liar and
thief, as charged. Each day, when
worry made its predictions, record of
them was carefully kept, and at the end
of the month the reports were checked
up by results. <em>Only three per cent. of the
predictions were even remotely realized!</em></p>

<p>The old proprietor of the business,
through whom the contagious poison
started, is dead, and the happy young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
menticulturist owns the business, which
has become very successful by influence
of the sunny optimism of its new
owner, which attracts trade unconsciously
to it.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="no-break"><a name="LOVE_CANNOT_BE_QUALIFIED" id="LOVE_CANNOT_BE_QUALIFIED"></a>LOVE CANNOT BE QUALIFIED.</h2>


<p>The merit of loving is in the act,
and should not&mdash;cannot&mdash;be qualified
by the merit or demerit of the object
under consideration.</p>

<p>There may be more effort required,
perhaps, in loving something that seems
to us unlovely, but no more virtue in so
doing, as loving, like virtue, is its own
reward.</p>

<p>God-love does not discriminate. It
is, therefore, ungodly to discriminate.
In the performance of the Man-Nature
partnership-function of "divine selection"
in the harmonizing of things that
are antagonistic to each other and to
Man&mdash;selecting for survival those
things that are not deterrent to the
harmonious growth and happiness of
Man&mdash;if selection is to be made, it
should be done in the spirit of calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
justice, and not in the spirit of hate,
for, as love blesses the lover, so does
hate react upon the hater.</p>

<p>We cannot afford <em>not to love</em>.</p>

<p>There are animals and insects that
seem to us to be undesirable and prejudicial
to the harmony we are seeking
to secure, that may serve most excellent
purposes in relation to existing
conditions. They are frequently a
warning against unfavorable conditions,
in the same way that pain is a warning
against diseased conditions in the body.
In the same way, crime is a warning
against social or political conditions
which invite or compel crime, and remedy
should be sought in change of the
conditions in preference to the punishment
of the crime. I believe that a
change of our point-of-view&mdash;our attitude
towards causes and effects&mdash;would
find punishment generally unnecessary,
and, as such, brutal.</p>

<p>There is, then, a double reason why
we should hate nothing. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
place, it is probable that we are hating
the wrong thing, and thereby are unjust,
and we are certainly doing injury
to ourselves by nursing the feeling of
hatred.</p>

<p>Disapproval&mdash;calm disapproval&mdash;is
a better judge in the exercise of
"divine selection" than angry antagonism.
Pity, as well as love, is a divine
attribute, but hate is an attribute of the
devil. Pity suggests change of conditions
producing inharmonious results.
Hate suggests punishment of the victim
of the inharmony.</p>

<p>In its relation to personal comfort,
the practice of not permitting hate, nor
annoyance, nor irritation, nor repulsion
to possess one's feelings, will bring
greatest good results. Take the mosquito
pest, for instance: One who begins
to feel irritation at the sound made
by the wings of the insect, is already
creating within himself a condition
favorable to inflammation from the
effects of the bite. Many who suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
by mosquitos admit that the buzz is
worse, to them, than the bite, which is
proof of a purely mental and unnecessary
affliction.</p>

<p>There was a time in my boyhood
when mosquitos poisoned and annoyed
me beyond endurance. Each bite represented
a great itching welt, and the
buzzing was full of terror in consequence,
or, more likely, in the light of
present knowledge, the buzzing inspired
fearthought or dread, and the
bite was very poisonous in consequence.
At present, mosquito bites are not
poisonous to me, and mosquito sounds
are no longer disagreeable. I do not
remember when the deliverance came.
Possibly the cure came through intimate
acquaintance. I have lived in
localities where the mosquito thrives
all the year round, and in such numbers
that he tires his victims into a
state of non-resistance, and in the calm
of non-resistance, physical and mental
irritations cease. This is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
called acclimatization, but it proves the
contention, whichever way it is interpreted.</p>

<p>In the practice of my freedom from
what was once a great affliction, I
sometimes brave a swarm of mosquitos
by sleeping in their presence without
drawing the bar. If the mosquitos
light on me freely, I find comfort in the
evidence of my popularity, and in the
fact that I am probably being of service
to something, or somebody, by possibly
diverting attentions that would not be
appreciated in like manner by them.
In the morning, when I look in the
glass and note the little red spots that
the bites have left, but of which I am
not otherwise conscious, I consider
them as a record of my hospitality, and
am proud of them, as the German
corps student is proud of the scars
on his face, that are a record of equally
foolish bravery or exposure, taken out
of his university course at Heidelberg
or elsewhere. My braving of the mosquitos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would certainly be classed as foolish,
except as a test of superiority, but
the pin-point red spots soon disappear
and do no permanent harm.</p>

<p>Mosquitos are said to breed in malarial
conditions, and for the purpose
of absorbing the malaria. Flies do not
exist except in conditions of ferment,
and are of greatest service in carrying
it away. Roaches are splendid scavengers,
and are a result, and not a cause,
of unclean conditions. Our warfare
should be waged against unclean
and inharmonious conditions, and not
against the purifiers and harmonizers
of the conditions.</p>

<p>It is not a difficult matter to rid
one's self of repulsions if the point-of-view
is changed. I presume that the
most generally detested creature that
is not altogether deadly in its venom is
the bedbug. The bedbug is more of a
tradition than a fact, and many of those
who shudder at mention of him have
never seen one of his kind. I am sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that none of his enemies have much if,
any, acquaintance with him, as to the
color of his eyes, his habits of thrift,
his amiability in his family and other
qualities that serve to make a creature
attractive and respectable within his
sphere.</p>

<p>The truth about this much despised
creature is that he is useful as a warning
against unclean conditions, and his
odor and his bite are his notes of warning.
Instead of filling one's self with
a feeling of repulsion or anger or any
other emotion that affects the free circulation
of the blood, and relaxes and
disorders the tissues of the body, at sight
or mention of a bedbug, the discovery
should elicit the expression, "Thank
you for the information." If it should
happen in one's own house, no hidden
crack nor corner should escape an overhauling
to get rid of the cause of the
bedbug's warning; or, if it should happen
in a hotel, there should be a change
of hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Mention is made of mosquitos and
roaches and bedbugs in this connection,
not for the purpose of degrading
the feeling of love by applying it to
things that are disagreeable, no matter
what their mission of usefulness, but to
put stress upon the fact that one cannot
afford to hate anything. It is
especially useful, in seeking to change
the point-of-view, to consider the
greatest of causes of repulsion in order
to more easily reach the lesser causes,
for the lesser fade of themselves by the
removal of the greater.</p>

<p>If you can learn not to hate a bedbug,
to thank a roach for informing
you of unclean conditions and to endure
mosquitos, you are pretty sure to
modify all prejudices by thus doing.</p>

<p>It is my own habit to read the last
chapter of a book first and if the summary
of its contentions and deductions,
which are sure to be found in the closing
chapter, interest me, I go carefully
through the book with the author to
learn how he has reached his conclusions.
I find, upon enquiry, that many
others do the same. This is made
necessary because of the vast number
of books that are published and the impossibility
of learning by other than the
easiest means more than a small proportion
of the ideas that are given out
each year. There are published, yearly,
in English, twenty to thirty thousand
volumes of new matter, or new arrangements
or new editions of old matter, so
that to read carefully only a catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of them would be a considerable task
for the ordinary reader.</p>

<p>This being the closing chapter of my
book, and being especially possessed of
my subject and desirous of being understood,
I may be pardoned for offering
a brief syllabus of my effort as a benediction.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to show that
fearthought is the arch-enemy of civilized
man. Through the fears of his
progenitors, it is the cause of the weaknesses
he inherits; and through his own
permission, it is also the cause of his
personally acquired ill health, ill success,
discontent and unhappiness. Fearthought,
however, can be eradicated
from the habit-of-thought of even the
most timid persons, who are cursed by
the hereditary affliction of fear, or by
their own weak habit-of-thought, by
persistent counter-suggestion, as soon
as they are convinced of the possibility
of freedom, and have thereby, learned
the profitable point-of-view regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
it. I have shown that forethought becomes
strong-thought as soon as fearthought,
or weak-thought, is separated
from it; that the condition of harmony
which is created by the eradication of
fearthought, is the normal condition in
civilized nature; that growth is immediate
and strong within the harmonic
atmosphere thus created; that happiness
is the certain result; and that fearthought
and its various expressions are
the basic deterrents to growth and happiness
in man. That God, in the process
of Evolution, has developed Man
to the point where he executes the
Higher Law of Harmony through the
exercise of Divine Selection in modifying
the brute law of "the survival of
the fittest" (or, strongest), and thereby
proves the "superiority of mind
over matter." That God has created
a partnership between Growth and Man,
which is properly distinguished as the
Man-Nature partnership. That the
functions of the partners are clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
defined by rigid limitations; Nature doing
all the growing without harmonizing
or cultivating anything; while Man
performs all of the harmonizing or cultivating,
but none of the growing. That
Man's only method of harmonizing or
cultivating is through learning and removing
the deterrents to growth. That
in watering plants, Man removes the
deterrent, drouth. That in building
hot-houses, Man removes the deterrent,
cold. That in oiling machinery,
Man removes the deterrent, friction.
That in refusing to be the bondman of
fearthought and anger and worry, Man
escapes the only deterrents within himself,
to harmony, health, growth and
happiness. And, that in cultivating
Appreciation all of the possibilities of
Happiness are opened to him.</p>

<p>I have tried to show that one of the
great deterrents to growth and the acquisition
of happiness is nursed by
focussing the point-of-view on worn-out
traditions, instead of on the present accomplishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and acceleration of progress
in which all of the elements of
happiness rest. That while happiness
is possible to all under present conditions,
indications point to the possibility,
within the assured possession of
surplus wealth-of-means, that Altruism
may soon "have an inning," during
which conditions will be so rearranged
that dire poverty and unhappiness will
be impossible to any but the perverse.
That normal, civilized human nature is
<em>good</em> nature, and that if conditions are
intelligently arranged most men will
eagerly mold themselves into good men
to fit the conditions. That the Material
Age has become so rich that it can now
afford leisure to give attention to the
Higher Self, and in so doing will soon
refuse to permit any one born under
the prejudices and the protection of the
Nation&mdash;the social family&mdash;to be ignorant
nor idle nor poor; that the era
of the three great A's&mdash;Appreciation,
Attraction and Altruism&mdash;is upon us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and that it will inaugurate the Age of
the Higher Self, wherein Man will realize
that he is not simply the highest
among animals, but is endowed with
divine possibilities, and cannot longer be
respectable with only animal characteristics.
That the resetting of the gauge
of respectability rendered necessary by
the Awakening, and the new conditions
that must grow out of it, will be above
the toleration of anything that is unaltruistic,
as surely as the gauge of the
present is above the toleration of petty
thieving and convicted perjury.</p>

<p>There is not only hope, but there <em>is
assurance</em>, of harmonic conditions in
the signs of the times and in the
constantly increasing acceleration of
progress.</p>

<p>It is argued that the Stoics and
other philosophers of ancient Greece
attained the perfection of self-control,
and successfully suppressed, and even
eliminated, all of the passions and desires
which so commonly dominate
man, and attained thereby a state of
happiness that is quite unknown in the
present times of ostentation and ambition;
but that the result was a state of
lethargic indifference, that became
more fatal to growth and progress in
the end than any known condition of
tumult and competition in the history
of the race.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly a just arraignment
of the result of the Grecian philosophical
teachings but, at the same
time, the reason for so unhappy a result
is not difficult to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greeks cultivated self-control
and the harmonic conditions growing
out of it as an end, and not as a preparatory
means to growth. They prepared
a weedless and wormless soil
within the mind, but in it planted poppies,
breathed of their poisonous perfume,
and slept the sleep of indifference,
which leads to the sleep called
death.</p>

<p>Since the time of the Stoics, the
world has been told by the God-Man
Jesus of Nazareth, that living means
growing, that true happiness is gained
only through works in the service of
something, that the necessary attribute
of perfect manhood is spontaneous altruism,
and that there is no other road
towards growth, refinement, spirituality
and happiness than along the way
made easy by consistent altruism.</p>

<p>During the time that has passed
since the power and glory of Hellas
began to wane, mankind has had experience
with the forces of nature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the efficacy of machinery to teach the
great universal law of compensation,
which is also the law of happiness.
This great law prescribes that there
shall be no balance without support or
motion, no poise without alertness, no
life without growth, and no happiness
without service.</p>

<p>Learning a wise lesson from the law
of compensation, man has come to appreciate
the value of a wormless and
weedless soil, but he has learned to
plant in it trees that bear altruistic
fruit, instead of the poppy of sloth and
indifference, which is now classed as a
poisonous weed; he has learned to
clean and polish the journals of his
engines and has invented balance
wheels to regulate, and ball bearings
to accelerate, their power; but not for
the purpose of idleness.</p>

<p>The decadence of Greek manhood
was not the result of culture, but the
result of the uses to which it was put,
and hence we should not condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
culture, nor cultivate friction, as an antidote
for decadence, because Greek
civilization did not defend itself against
assault and decay, but, rather, let us
emulate the good they achieved, and
cultivate the power they attained, and
use them as <em>a beginning and not as
an end</em>.</p>

<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF FEAR IN DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="center"><b><small><span class="smcap">By Dr. Wm. H. Holcomb.</span></small></b></p>


<p>Our sanitarians are doing a good work in
exploring the physical causes of disease, and
endeavoring to protect the individual and
the public health. But there is a higher and
larger sphere of causes which they have seldom
penetrated, and of whose existence even
many of them seem to be ignorant. I allude
to the extraordinary influence of affection
and thought, or of emotion and ideas, in the
causation and prevention of disease.</p>

<p>The body is a mirror, in which all the
states of the soul are reflected. We are
familiar with the wonderful effects of the
will, the passions, the emotions, of the imagination,
sympathy, hope, fear, faith, and confident
expectation upon the physical system.
We are accustomed to regard the phenomena
as illustrations of the fact that the soul can,
under certain circumstances, act powerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
upon the body, with the tacit assumption,
however, as a general rule, that the body
executes all the functions by chemical or
mechanical law, without the necessary intervention
of any mental influences whatever.
This is the great illusion of the materialist.</p>

<p>Imagination, intellect, will, emotion, faith,
hope, expectation, etc., are only states or
modes of the soul's own life, and they are in
perpetual activity, whether we are conscious
of it or not. The operations of the soul of
which we are not conscious, are almost infinite
in comparison with the very small portion
of them which comes at any moment
within the range of our external consciousness.
The soul organizes its own body in the
womb of the mother, holds all its parts together
in due order and functional activity
during life, and when he quits it at death,
its material tenement falls into dissolution.</p>

<p>The mind of man is constantly at work,
silently pervading every tissue of his body
by its vital influence, repeating itself in
every function, throbbing in the heart,
breathing in the lungs, reflecting itself in the
blood, weaving its own form into every act
of nutrition, realizing its own life in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
sensation, and working its own will in every
motion. The power of the mind over the
body indeed! There is no power in the body,
but in the mind, for the body is the mind,
translated into flesh and blood.</p>

<p>When a limb is broken&mdash;the bones shattered,
the flesh torn, the blood-vessels severed,
the nerves lacerated, what can the surgeon
or doctor do to repair the injury? A
little outside mechanical work. He ligates,
he stitches, he plasters, he fixes the parts in
apparatus so they will remain motionless
in the natural position. He can do no
more. The soul which creates the body and
keeps it in health, repairs it when injured.
By her own occult forces she regulates the
movement of the blood and development of
nerve power, the chemical decomposition
and re-combination, going on in every tissue,
according to ideas and models implanted
upon her by the Divine Mind, the Over-Soul
of the universe.</p>

<p>The old writers call this wonderful power
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturi</i>, the curative power
of nature. Swedenborg, for whom nature
has no powers underived from spiritual
sources, teaches that this vital power is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
soul itself. His view that the soul itself acts
unconsciously to our perceptions in the development
and conservation of the body is
advocated by Morell in his "Elements of
Psychology," and is highly spoken of by
Professor William B. Carpenter.</p>

<p>When we have constructed a true psychological
pathology, we shall understand
clearly why and how it is that fear can turn
the hair gray in a single night; that a
mother's milk can be poisoned by a moment
of terror; that the heart may be paralyzed
by a sudden joy or sorrow; that dyspepsia,
paralysis, and many other diseases
are produced by mental worry and fret and
the brain-fag of overwork and anxiety. Yea,
we will understand that away back of all
physical causation, the roots of our disease
originate in the spiritual conditions of the
race, in our false religions, our false philosophies,
our false way of thinking, our false
relations to God and each other.</p>

<p>The most extensive of all the morbid
mental conditions which reflect themselves
so disastrously on the human system, is the
state of fear. It has many degrees or gradations,
from the state of extreme alarm, fright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
or terror, down to the slightest shade of apprehension
of impending evil. But all along
the line it is the same thing&mdash;a paralyzing
impression upon the centers of life which
can produce, through the agency of the
nervous system, a vast variety of morbid
symptoms in every tissue of the body.</p>

<p>We have very seldom reflected upon the
fact that fear runs like a baleful thread
through the whole web of our life from beginning
to end. We are born into the atmosphere
of fear and dread, and the mother
who bore us had lived in the same atmosphere
for weeks and months before we were
born. We are surrounded in infancy and
childhood by clouds of fear and apprehension
on the part of our parents, nurses, and
friends. As we advance in life we become,
instinctively or by experience, afraid of almost
everything. We are afraid of our
parents, afraid of our teachers, afraid of our
playmates, afraid of ghosts, afraid of rules
and regulations and punishments, afraid of
the doctor, the dentist, the surgeon. Our
adult life is a state of chronic anxiety, which
is fear in a milder form. We are afraid of
failure in business, afraid of disappointments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and mistakes, afraid of enemies, open or
concealed; afraid of poverty, afraid of public
opinion, afraid of accidents, of sickness,
of death, and unhappiness after death. Man
is like a haunted animal from the cradle to
the grave, the victim of real or imaginary
fears, not only his own, but those reflected
upon him from the superstitions, self-deceptions,
sensory illusions, false beliefs and concrete
errors of the whole human race, past
and present.</p>

<p>If fear produces disease, acute or chronic,
suddenly or gradually, through the correlations
existing between the spirit and the
body, how can there be a genuinely and perfectly
healthy man or woman in the world?
There is none.</p>

<p>That fear does produce all kinds of disease,
has been frequently observed and fully
substantiated by the medical profession. Dr.
Tuke, in his admirable book, "Influence of
the Mind upon the Body," cites well
authenticated instances of the following diseases
as having been produced by fear or
fright: Insanity, idiocy, paralysis of various
muscles and organs, profuse perspirations,
cholerina, jaundice, turning of the hair gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in a short time, baldness, sudden decay of
the teeth, nervous shock followed by fatal
anæmia, uterine troubles, malformation of
embryo through the mother, and even skin
disease&mdash;erysipelas, eczema, and impetigo.</p>

<p>We observe in this list that fear not only
affects the mind and the nervous and muscular
tissues, but the molecular chemical
transformations of the organic network, even
to the skin, the hair, and the teeth. This
might be expected of a passion which disturbs
the whole mind, which is represented
or externalized in the whole body.</p>

<p>Dr. Tuke reiterates the fact which has
been so frequently observed, that epidemics
owe a great deal of their rapid extension
and violence to the panic of fear which exists
among the people. When yellow fever,
cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, and other
malignant diseases obtain a footing in a community,
hundreds and thousands of people
fall victims to their own mental conditions,
which invite the attack and insure its fatality.
When the disease was new and strange,
as the yellow fever was to the interior in its
visitation in 1878, when the doctors were
not familiar with it, the nurses not trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to it, the people, having no confidence in its
management, lost hope, their fears became
excessive, and consequent mortality was
frightful.</p>

<p>How does fear operate upon the body to
produce sickness? By paralyzing the nerve
centres, especially those of the vasomotor
nerves, thus producing not only muscular
relaxation, but capillary congestions of all
kinds. This condition of the system invites
attack, and there is no resilience, or power
of resistance. The gates of the citadel
have been opened from within, and the
enemy may enter at any point.</p>

<p>What determines the specific nature of
the disease which attacks a person thus prostrated
by fear? Men are frequently prostrated
by fear in storms or fire or earthquakes
or accidents, and no disease results.
It is because they have been not thinking
and brooding over any special morbid conditions.
But in an epidemic, say of yellow
fever, the subjects connected with the disease
are strongly pictured on the mind.
They are talked of, read about, discussed
and written about, until the mind is full of
images of fever, delirium, black vomit, jaundice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
death, funerals, etc. When such is the
case, no microbes or bacteria are needed to
produce an outburst of yellow fever. The
whole mass of horrors already stamped upon
the mind is simply reflected and repeated in
the body.</p>

<p>"As a man thinketh, so is he," said Solomon.
Thoughts become things, apprehensions
take form and substance, and lo! the
disease. In the height of his happiness and
prosperity, Job permitted himself to brood
in silent fear over the possibility of losses
and misfortunes, and he had at last to exclaim,
"The thing which I greatly feared
has come upon me."</p>

<p>Sudden and great fears are not frequent.
The fears of every day, the constant apprehensions
and anxieties of life, which are
really fears of impending evil, prey upon
our vitality and lessen our power of resisting,
so that any passing disease may be photographed
on our minds and seen upon our
bodies.</p>

<p>Fear is itself a contagious disease, and is
sometimes reflected from one to another
mind with great rapidity. It needs no speech
or sign to propagate it, for by psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
laws we are just beginning to comprehend,
it passes from one to another, from
the healthy to the sick, from the doctor or
the nurse to the patient, from the mother to
the child. Thus malignant influences may be
cast around us by even our best friends and
would-be helpers, under whose baleful
shadow, without our even knowing of its existence,
we and our children may sicken and
die.</p>

<p>The summer of 1888 was signalized by a
moderately severe epidemic of yellow fever
at Jacksonville, Florida, and a very extensive
epidemic of fear throughout the Southern
states. The latter disease was much
more contagious than the former, and much
less amenable to treatment. This mental
malady visited every little town, village, and
railway station, and kept the people in a
chill of trepidation for many weeks. This
causeless and senseless terror originated
many precipitate and unjust measures of self-defense.
Under its influence public and
private rights were disrespected, and the
panic greatly intensified. In a few cases
the refugee was driven from the door, the
hungry left unfed, the sick unattended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
There was exhibited on a small scale, here
and there, that same principle of terror
which is manifested in a burning theatre, on
a sinking ship, or in a stampeded army,
when brave men suddenly become cowards,
and wise men fools, and merciful men
brutes.</p>

<p>Truly, something ought to be done for
the moral treatment of yellow fever.</p>

<p>I will relate an anecdote of Dr. Samuel
Cartwright, of Natchez, Mississippi, which
furnishes an ideal type for the mental treatment
of yellow fever.</p>

<p>It was away back in the thirties, and yellow
fever was prevailing in New Orleans,
and the places above it were in a state of
watchful fear. A young Northern teacher,
trying to return home, started from Woodville,
Mississippi, and arrived at Natchez
about midnight in a high fever. Dr. Cartwright
was immediately called in. Early
in the morning he summoned the officers of
the hotel and all the regular boarders into
the parlor and made them a little speech.
"This young lady," he said, "has yellow
fever. It is not contagious. None of you
will take it from her; and if you will follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
my advice you will save this town from a
panic, and a panic is the hotbed of an epidemic.
Say nothing about this case. Ignore
it absolutely. Let the ladies of the house
help nurse her, and take flowers and delicacies
to her, and act altogether as if it were
some every-day affair, unattended by danger.
It will save her life, and perhaps in
the long run many others."</p>

<p>It was agreed to by all but one person&mdash;a
woman, who proceeded to quarantine
herself in the most remote room of the
establishment. The young teacher got well,
and no one was sick in the house but the
self-quarantined woman, who took yellow
fever from fear, but happily recovered.</p>

<p>By his great reputation and his strong
magnetic power, Dr. Cartwright dissipated
the fears of those around him, and prevented
an epidemic. For this grand appreciation
and successful application of a principle&mdash;the
power of mind and thought over physical
conditions, a power just dawning on the
perception of the race&mdash;he deserves a nobler
monument than any we have accorded to
heroes and statesmen.</p>

<p>The sanitarians of the present day would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
think on the contrary that Dr. Cartwright
was worthy of condemnation and imprisonment.
Dr. Cartwright, however, honestly
believed that yellow fever was not a contagious
disease. At that time the non-contagionists
were numerous, learned, experienced,
and respectable. The contagionists,
however, finally carried the day in the face
of innumerable evidences of non-contagion,
which, strangely enough, have now about
ceased to exist. Whether they transformed
a non-contagious into a contagious disease
by repeated and violent asseverations, which
played upon and hypnotized the professional
and public mind, is a subtle point for psychological
investigation, not likely to be made
by the present generation of doctors.</p>

<p>Can a non-contagious disease become
contagious by mental action? The power
of fear to modify the currents of the blood
and all the secretions, to whiten the hair, to
paralyze the nervous system, and even to
produce death is well known. Its power to
impress organic changes upon the child in
the womb through the mother's mind is well
established. When yellow fever is reported
about and believed to be imminent and contagious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
fear, combined with a vivid imagination
of the horrors and woes of the pest, can
precipitate sickness which will take on the
form and color present to the thought, and
yellow fever may spread rapidly from person
to person, all through the medium of
the mind. "Everything," said a great
philosopher, "was at first a thought."</p>

<p>We see a non-contagious disease in the
very process of transformation into a contagious
one in the case of pulmonary consumption.
It was observed occasionally
that one of the married partners who had
nursed the other through the disease fell a
victim after a while to the same malady.
Doctors and people began to suggest contagion.
The cases of one attack following
the other were noticed more and more, and
were reported in the medical journals. It
was spoken of, thought of, brooded over.
The confirmatory cases were all carefully
noted; the failures to infect were all ignored,
as they always are by people who are looking
for contagion. The germ theory has
given a great impetus to the idea of contagion.
Dr. Loomis actually classifies
tuberculosis among miasmatic contagious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
diseases. Fear will do the rest. In another
generation the occasional fact will be
a common fact, and in still another, a fixed
fact; and the contagiousness of consumption
will be enrolled among the concrete errors
of the profession. Such has probably been
the genesis of all contagious diseases in the
remote past.</p>

<p>Fear being recognized as a powerful
cause of disease, and a direct and great obstacle
to recovery, a wise sanitation will exert
itself to prevent or antidote its influences.
To eradicate fear is to avert disease, to
shorten its duration, diminish its virulence,
and promote recovery. How shall we accomplish
it? By educating the people up
to a higher standard of life. By teaching
them a sounder hygiene, a wiser philosophy,
a more cheerful theology. By erasing a
thousand errors, delusions, and superstitions
from their minds, and giving instead the
light, the beauty, and the loveliness of truth.
There is a mental and moral sanitation ahead
of us, which is far more valuable and desirable
than all our quarantines, inventions, experimentations,
and microscopic search for
physical causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>I will draw the picture of a sick room in
charge of physicians and nurse, by whom
this enlighted sanitation has been ignored or
unheeded. It is a chamber of fear, soon, in
all probability, to be the chamber of death.
The room is darkened, for they are afraid of
the light, that emblem of God's wisdom
which should shine into all rooms, except
when it is disagreeable to the patient. The
ventilation is insufficient, for draughts, you
must know, are very dangerous. The friends
have doleful faces, moist eyes, sad voices,
which reveal danger and doubt, and they
converse in subdued whispers, which alarm
and annoy the patient. The nurse and the
doctor sometimes talk of their cases before
the sick man, tell how very ill they were,
how they suffered, how they got well miraculously,
or how they died. The sympathetic
visitor regales his hearers, the patient included,
with his or her knowledge of similar
cases, and their results, the great amount of
sickness prevailing, and the success or ill
success of this or that doctor.</p>

<p>They all agree that it is dangerous to
change the patient's linen, dangerous to
sponge the body, dangerous to give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cold water; milk is feverish, meat is too
strong. A shadow of fear seems to hang
over everybody. The pulse is counted, the
temperature is taken. Nurse or nearest
friend wants to know aloud the report of the
watch and the thermometer. The doctor
answers aloud, and all look grave. And so
it goes on day after day, thoughts and
images of pain and sickness and danger and
death being impressed and reflected upon
the mind of the patient, and the great, sound,
glorious spirit within finds it impossible to
break through this dense atmosphere of material
superstitions, fear, ignorance, and
folly, and restore its own body to health and
happiness.</p>

<p>The true sanitarian will remember in his
treatment the tremendous power of words
and ideas upon the sick. He will never indicate
by his language, his looks, or his conduct
that he thinks the patient is very ill.
He will cleanse his own mind of morbid
fears and apprehensions, and reflect the stimulating
light of hope on all around him.
The suppression of anxiety, and even sometimes
of sympathy, is necessary. His sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
should not be discussed before the patient,
or any other case of sickness alluded
to. The doctor's opinion of the case should
never be asked, and never given within the patient's
hearing. Erase, as far as possible, all
thoughts of disease, danger, or death. The
sick-room should not be darkened and made
silent. It should be made cheerful and
natural, as if no sickness existed. It should
have fresh air, and cool water, and the fragrance
of flowers, instead of the odor of
drugs. Hope, and not fear, should be the
presiding genius of the place.</p>

<p>The mind-curers and the Christian Scientists
say that almost all acute diseases can
be cured without medicine by the simple
dissipation of fear from the mind of the patient,
of his friends, and of his doctor.
Whether this be true or not, it is very certain
that when an epidemic is threatened or
prevailing, the people who are constantly
talking about and discussing the disease, the
newspapers which daily report its progress
and fatality, and the doctors and nurses who
ventilate their experiences, who predict evil,
speak ominously and enjoin all sorts of precautions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
are themselves fomenters and carriers
of the disease, infectious centers to the
whole community.</p>

<p>Education can do much, but it is useless
to expect the total eradication of fear without
the aid and guidance of the religious
principle. Fear is the cry of the wounded
selfhood for something he has suffered or
lost, or is about to lose. "Perfect love casteth
out fear"&mdash;the perfect love of God and
the neighbor. He who is in bondage to the
senses has everything to dread. He alone
is free from all apprehensions whose heart
and mind are stayed upon the living God.
He truly "sits under his own vine and fig-tree,
with none to make him afraid."</p>

<h3>MR. KENNAN'S APPRENTICESHIP
IN COURAGE.</h3>


<p>Mr. George Kennan's great work in Russian
exploration and in the investigation of
Russian institutions has been due to certain
qualities of character which impress
every one who knows him well. Of these
qualities, bravery and strength of will are
not the least conspicuous. In his conversations
with me, he has often spoken of certain
things in connection with his own development
and training, which are of much
interest. Once when I spoke to him of his
bravery and coolness under danger, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many things which have been significant
and controlling in what I may call my
psychological life are wholly unknown to
my friends, and yet they might be made
public, if you wish. For instance, as I look
back to my boyhood, the cause of the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
unhappiness that boyhood had for me was a
secret but a deeply rooted suspicion that I
was physically a coward. This gave me intense
suffering. I do not know precisely at
what time I first became conscious of it, but
when I peered, one day, through the window
of a surgeon's office to see an amputation I
had proof of my fear. One of my playmates
had caught his hand between two
cog-wheels in a mill, and his arm had been
badly crushed. When he was taken to the
surgeon's office, I followed to see what was
going to be done with him. While I was
watching the amputation, with my face
pressed to the glass of the window, the surgeon
accidentally let slip from his forceps
the end of one of the severed arteries, and
a jet of blood spurted against the inside of
the window-pane. The result upon me was
a sensation that I had never had before in
all my life,&mdash;a sensation of nausea, faintness,
and overwhelming fear. I was twenty-four
hours in recovering from the shock, and
from that time I began to think about the
nature of my emotions and the unsuspected
weakness of my character.</p>

<p>"I had a nervous, imaginative temperament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and not long after this incident I began
to be tortured by a vague suspicion
that I was lacking in what we now call
'nerve,' that I was afraid of things that involved
suffering or peril. I brooded over
this suggestion of physical cowardice until
I became almost convinced of its reality,
and at last I came to be afraid of things
that I had never before thought about. In
less than a year I had lost much of my self-respect,
and was as miserable as a boy could
be. It all seems now very absurd and childish,
but at that time, with my boyish visions
of travel and exploration, it was a spiritual
tragedy. 'Of what use is it to think of exploration
and wild life in wild countries,'
I used to ask myself, 'if the first time my
courage or fortitude is put to the test I become
faint and sick?'</p>

<p>"I began at last to experiment upon myself,&mdash;to
do things that were dangerous
merely to see whether I dared do them; but
the result was only partially reassuring. I
could not get into much danger in a sleepy
little village like Norwalk, Ohio, and although
I found I could force myself to walk
around the six-inch stone coping of a bell-tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
five stories from the ground (a most
perilous and foolhardy exploit), and go and
sit alone in a graveyard in the middle of
dark, still nights, I failed to recover my own
respect. My self-reproach continued for a
year or two, during which I was as wretched
as a boy can be who admires courage above
all things and has a high ideal of intrepid
manhood, but who secretly fears that he
himself is hopelessly weak and nerveless.
There was hardly a day that I did not say
to myself, 'You'll never be able to do the
things that you dream about; you haven't
any self-reliance or nerve. Even as a little
child you were afraid of the dark; you
shrink now from fights and rows, and you
turn faint at the mere sight of blood.
You're nothing but a coward.'</p>

<p>"At last, when I was seventeen or eighteen
years of age, I went to Cincinnati as a
telegraph operator. I had become so morbid
and miserable by that time that I said
one day, 'I'm going to put an end to this
state of affairs here and now. If I'm afraid
of anything, I'll conquer my fear of it or
die. If I'm a coward I might as well be
dead, because I can never feel any self-respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
or have any happiness in life; and
I'd rather get killed trying to do something
that I'm afraid to do than to live in this
way.' I was at that time working at night,
and had to go home from the office between
midnight and four o'clock A. M. It was
during the Civil War, and Cincinnati was a
more lawless city than it has ever been
since. Street robberies and murders were of
daily occurrence, and all of the 'night men'
in our office carried weapons as a matter of
course. I bought a revolver, and commenced
a course of experiments upon myself.
When I finished my night work at
the office, instead of going directly home
through well-lighted and police-patrolled
streets, I directed my steps to the slums
and explored the worst haunts of vice and
crime in the city. If there was a dark, narrow,
cut-throat alley down by the river that
I felt afraid to go through at that hour of
the night, I clenched my teeth, cocked my
revolver, and went through it,&mdash;sometimes
twice in succession. If I read in the morning
papers that a man had been robbed or
murdered on a certain street, I went to that
street the next night. I explored the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
river-banks, hung around low drinking-dives
and the resorts of thieves and other
criminals, and made it an invariable rule to
do at all hazards the thing that I thought I
might be afraid to do. Of course I had all
sorts of experiences and adventures. One
night I saw a man attacked by highwaymen
and knocked down with a slung-shot, just
across the street. I ran to his assistance,
frightened away the robbers, and picked
him up from the gutter in a state of unconsciousness.
Another night, after two o'clock,
I saw a man's throat cut, down by the river,&mdash;and
a ghastly sight it was; but, although
somewhat shaken, I did not become faint or
sick. Every time I went through a street
that I believed to be dangerous, or had any
startling experience, I felt an accession of
self-respect.</p>

<p>"In less than three months I had satisfied
myself that while I did feel fear, I was not
so much daunted by any undertaking but I
could do it if I willed to do it, and then I began
to feel better.</p>

<p>"Not long after this I went on my first
expedition to Siberia, and there, in almost
daily struggles with difficulties, dangers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sufferings of all sorts, I finally lost the fear
of being afraid which had poisoned the happiness
of my boyhood. It has never
troubled me, I think, since the fall of 1867,
when I was blown out to sea one cold and
pitch-dark night in a dismasted and sinking
sailboat, in a heavy, offshore gale, without a
swallow of water or a mouthful of food. I
faced then for about four hours what seemed
to be certain death, but I was steady, calm,
and under perfect self-control."</p>

<h3><a name="ADVERTISEMENT_OF_MENTICULTURE" id="ADVERTISEMENT_OF_MENTICULTURE"></a>ADVERTISEMENT OF "MENTICULTURE."</h3>


<p>"Menticulture" was first issued in a sufficiently
modest way. It described a personal experience
which has been of inestimable value to the author.
The revelation to him of the possibility of the absolute
elimination of the seeds of unhappiness has changed
life from a period of constant struggle to a period of
security and repose, and has insured delightful realities
instead of uncertain possibilities. One hundred
and fifty copies of the book were privately printed,
and entitled "The A B C of True Living." It also
carried within its pages the title of "Emancipation."</p>

<p>The suggestion met with such hearty appreciation
on the part of personal friends in many various walks
of life, that a public edition was proposed, and the
name of "Menticulture," a name that had to be coined
for the purpose, was chosen for it.</p>

<p>The aptness of the suggestion has been evidenced
by the approval of the brotherhood at large by appreciative
notices in many of the leading periodicals
of the country, by the receipt of more than a thousand
personal letters by the author, many of them attesting
to greatest benefits growing out of the new
point of view of life suggested by the book, and by
very large sales.</p>

<p>One gentleman&mdash;altruist&mdash;whose name is W. J.
Van Patten, found the suggestion contained in "Menticulture"
so helpful to himself and friends that he
purchased a special edition of two thousand copies of
the book for distribution in his home city of Burlington,
Vermont, one to each household, with the idea of
accentuating the suggestion by widespread inter-discussion.
The special Burlington edition has an
inset page bearing Mr. Van Patten's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</i>
for the distribution, which reads as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>


<h3>PERSONAL NOTE.</h3>

<p>Some time in the early part of the year 1896 a friend
sent me a copy of "Menticulture." I read it with
interest, and became convinced that I could apply its
truths to my own life with profit. Experience confirmed
my faith in the power of its principles to overcome
many of the most annoying and damaging ills
that are common to humanity.</p>

<p>I procured a number of copies from time to time
and gave to friends who I felt would appreciate it.
The universal testimony to the good which the little
book did, and the new strength of purpose and will it
gave to some who were sore beset with the cares and
worries of life, increased my interest and my confidence
in the truths set forth.</p>

<p>I formed the idea of making an experiment by giving
the book a general distribution in our city, to see
if it would not promote the general good and happiness
of people.</p>

<p>I wrote to the author, Mr. Fletcher, and he entered
into the plan very cordially, and had this special edition
prepared for me. The object which we hope to
gain is to turn the thoughts and purposes of those
whom we reach to the old truths taught by Christ, and
a determination to live above those evils which do so
much to make our lives unhappy for ourselves and
annoying to those about us.</p>

<p>I would ask, therefore, that you would kindly give
the book careful and thoughtful reading, and, when
you have opportunity, recommend it to your friends.</p>

<p class="right">

<h3>PERSONAL NOTE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Van Patten is a prominent manufacturer of
Vermont, and was recently Mayor of Burlington for
two years. He is also prominent in the Christian Endeavorer
movement, having been the first president
of the United Society, and being at present one of its
trustees, as well as the president of the Congregational
Club of western Vermont.</p>

<p>"Menticulture" has found favor among physicians,
and also with life-insurance companies, obviously
because of the live-saving quality of the suggestions
contained in it.</p>

<h3>THE ESSENTIALS AND SEQUENCE IN LIFE</h3>


<p>It would seem a considerable departure
from the study of menticulture as advised
in the author's book, "Menticulture," to
jump at once to an investigation of the
physiology and psychology of nutrition of
the body and then over to the department
of infant and child care and education as
pursued in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêche</i> and in the kindergarten;
but as a matter of fact, if study
of the causation of human disabilities and
misfortunes is attempted at all, the quest
leads naturally into all the departments of
human interest, and first into these primary
departments.</p>

<p>The object of this statement is to
link up the different publications of the
writer into a chain of consistent suggestions
intended to make life a more simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and agreeable problem than many of us
too indifferent or otherwise inefficient and
bad fellow-citizens make of it.</p>

<p>It is not an altogether unselfish effort
on the part of the author of the A. B. C.
Life Series to publish his findings. In the
consideration of his own mental and physical
happiness it is impossible to leave out
environment, and all the units of humanity
who inhabit the world are part of his and
of each other's environment.</p>

<p>It would be rank presumption for any
person, even though gifted with the means
to circulate his suggestions as widely as
possible, and armed with the power to
compel the reading of his publications,
to think that any suggestions of his could
influence any considerable number of his
fellow-citizens of the world, or even of his
own immediate neighbourhood, to accept
or follow his advice relative to the management
of their lives and of their communal
and national affairs; but while the
general and complete good of humanity
should be aimed at in all publications,

come first, and the wave of influence
spreads according to the effectiveness of
the ideas suggested in doing good; that
is, in altering the point of view and conduct
of people so as to make them a better
sympathetic environment.</p>

<p>For instance, the children of your
neighbours are likely to be the playmates
of your own children, and the children of
degenerate parents in the slum district
of your city will possibly be the fellow-citizen
partners of your own family. Again,
when it is known that right or wrong nutrition
of the body is the most important
agent in forming character, in establishing
predisposition to temperance or intemperance
of living, including the desire for
intoxicating stimulants, it is revealed to
one that right nutrition of the community
as a whole is an important factor in his
own environment, as is self-care in the
case of his own nourishment.</p>

<p>The moment a student of every-day
philosophy starts the study of problems
from the A. B. C. beginning of things,
and to shape his study according to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
A. B. C. sequence, each cause of inharmony
is at once traced back to its first expression
in himself and then to causes
influenced by his environments.</p>

<p>If we find that the largest influences
for good or bad originate with the right
or wrong instruction of children during
the home training or kindergarten period
of their development, and that a dollar
expended for education at that time is
worth more for good than whole bancs
of courts and whole armies of police to
correct the effect of bad training and bad
character later in life, it is quite logical
to help promote the spread of the kindergarten
or the kindergarten idea to include
all of the children born into the world,
and to furnish mothers and kindergarten
teachers with knowledge relative to the
right nutrition of their wards which they
can themselves understand and can teach
effectively to children.</p>

<p>If we also find that the influence of the
kindergarten upon the parents of the infants
is more potent than any other which
can be brought to bear upon them, we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
clearly that the way to secure the widest
reform in the most thorough manner is
to concentrate attention upon the kindergarten
phase of education, advocate its
extension to include even the last one of
the children, beginning with the most
needy first, and extending the care outward
from the centre of worst neglect to
finally reach the whole.</p>

<p>Experience in child saving so-called,
and in child education on the kindergarten
principle, has taught the cheapest
and the most profitable way to insure
an environment of good neighbours and
profit-earning citizens; and investigation
into the problem of human alimentation
shows that a knowledge of the elements of
an economic nutrition is the first essential
of a family or school training; and also
that this is most impressive when taught
during the first ten years of life.</p>

<p>One cannot completely succeed in the
study of menticulture from its A. B. C.
beginning and in A. B. C. sequence without
appreciation of the interrelation of
the physical and the mental, the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and the social, in attaining a complete
mastery of the subject.</p>

<p>The author of the A. B. C. Life
Series has pursued his study of the
philosophy of life in experiences which
have covered a great variety of occupations
in many different parts of the world
and among peoples of many different
nations and races. His first book, "Menticulture,"
dealt with purging the mind
and habits of sundry weaknesses and deterrents
which have possession of people
in general in some degree. He recognised
the depressing effect of anger and
worry and other phases of <em>fearthought</em>.
In the book "Happiness," which followed
next in order, <em>fearthought</em> was shown to be
the unprofitable element of forethought.
The influence of environment on each
individual was revealed as an important
factor of happiness, or the reverse, by
means of an accidental encounter with a
neglected waif in the busy streets of
Chicago during a period of intense
national excitement incident to the war
with Spain, and this led to the publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of "That Last Waif; or, Social Quarantine."
During the time that this last
book was being written, attention to the
importance of right nutrition was invited
by personal disabilities, and the experiments
described in "Glutton or Epicure;
or, Economic Nutrition" were begun and
have continued until now.</p>

<p>In the study of the latter, but most
important factor in profitable living, circumstances
have greatly favoured the
author, as related in his latest book,
"The A. B.-Z. of Our Own Nutrition."</p>

<p>The almost phenomenal circulation of
"Menticulture" for a book of its kind,
and a somewhat smaller interest in the
books on nutrition and the appeal for
better care of the waifs of society, showed
that most persons wished, like the author,
to find a short cut to happiness by
means of indifference to environment,
both internal and external, while habitually
sinning against the physiological
dietetic requirements of Nature. In smothering
worry and guarding against anger the
psychic assistance of digestion was stimulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and some better results were thereby
obtained, but not the best attainable
results.</p>

<p>Living is easy and life may be made
constantly happy by beginning right; and
the right beginning is none other than
the careful feeding of the body. This
done there is an enormous reserve of
energy, a naturally optimistic train of
thought, a charitable attitude towards
everybody, and a loving appreciation of
everything that God has made. Morbidity
of temperament will disappear from an
organism that is economically and rightly
nourished, and death will cease to have
any terrors for such; and as <em>fear</em> of death
is the worst depressant known, many of
the <em>worries</em> of existence take their everlasting
flight from the atmosphere of the
rightly nourished.</p>

<p>The wide interest now prevalent in
the subjects treated in The A. B. C. Life
Series is evidenced by the scientific, military,
and lay activity, in connection with
the experiments at the Sheffield Scientific
School of Yale University and elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as related in the "A. B.-Z. of Our Own
Nutrition" and in "The New Glutton or
Epicure" of the series.</p>

<p>The general application is more fully
shown, however, by the indorsement of
the great Battle Creek Sanitarium, which
practically studies all phases of the subject,
from health conservation and child
saving to general missionary work in
social reform.</p>
